# OSFI CAR Batch Analysis Tool

## Overview

The OSFI CAR Batch Analysis Tool processes multiple regulatory questions and generates comprehensive Markdown reports with complete agent reasoning, decision-making steps, and regulatory guidance.

## Features

‚úÖ **Batch Processing** - Process multiple questions automatically  
‚úÖ **Complete Reasoning Visibility** - Shows every step of agent thinking  
‚úÖ **Professional Markdown Output** - Publication-ready reports  
‚úÖ **Multiple Input Formats** - Support for .txt and .json question files  
‚úÖ **Detailed Analytics** - Reasoning pattern analysis and statistics  
‚úÖ **Error Handling** - Graceful handling of failed analyses  

## Quick Start

### 1. Prepare Your Questions

**Text Format (questions.txt):**
```
What is the definition of default and the associated capital treatment of defaulted exposure?
What is the minimum Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio requirement?
How do you calculate risk-weighted assets for credit risk?
```

**JSON Format (questions.json):**
```json
{
  "questions": [
    "What is the definition of default and the associated capital treatment of defaulted exposure?",
    "What is the minimum Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio requirement?",
    "How do you calculate risk-weighted assets for credit risk?"
  ]
}
```

### 2. Run the Analysis

```bash
# Basic usage
source .venv/bin/activate
python osfi_batch_analysis.py -q questions.txt -o report.md

# With custom title
python osfi_batch_analysis.py -q questions.txt -o report.md -t "My OSFI Analysis"

# Using JSON input
python osfi_batch_analysis.py -q questions.json -o comprehensive_report.md
```

### 3. Review Your Report

The generated Markdown file contains:
- Executive summary with statistics
- Complete reasoning process for each question
- Regulatory guidance with OSFI references
- Pattern analysis and insights

## Command Line Options

```
--questions, -q     Path to questions file (.txt or .json) [REQUIRED]
--output, -o        Output Markdown file (default: osfi_car_analysis_report.md)
--title, -t         Report title (default: "OSFI CAR Analysis Report")
--pdf-dir          PDF directory (default: "osfi car")
--api-key          Google API key for Gemini
```

## Sample Questions

### Basic Regulatory Questions
- What is the minimum Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio requirement?
- How do you calculate risk-weighted assets for credit risk?
- What are the components of Tier 1 capital?

### Complex Analysis Questions
- What is the definition of default and the associated capital treatment of defaulted exposure?
- Explain the difference between the standardized approach and internal ratings-based approach
- How are operational risk capital requirements calculated under Basel III?

### Implementation Questions
- What are the eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments?
- Explain the treatment of mortgage exposures under the standardized approach
- How does the capital conservation buffer work in practice?

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Question Files

**Structured JSON with Metadata:**
```json
{
  "title": "OSFI CAR Compliance Review",
  "description": "Questions for annual compliance assessment",
  "questions": [
    "What is the minimum CET1 ratio?",
    "How do we calculate operational risk capital?"
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "department": "Risk Management",
    "review_date": "2024-08-05"
  }
}
```

### Batch Processing Large Question Sets

For large question sets (50+ questions):
1. Split into smaller batches for better performance
2. Use descriptive output filenames
3. Monitor processing time and memory usage

```bash
# Process in batches
python osfi_batch_analysis.py -q batch_1_questions.txt -o batch_1_report.md
python osfi_batch_analysis.py -q batch_2_questions.txt -o batch_2_report.md
```

## Sample Output Structure

```markdown
# OSFI CAR Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
- Total Questions Processed: 10
- Successful Analyses: 10
- Total Reasoning Steps: 140

## Analysis Results

### Question 1
**Query:** *What is the minimum CET1 ratio?*

#### üß† Agent Reasoning Process
**ü§î Step 1 - Decision**
- Action: Evaluating user query complexity
- Reasoning: Need to determine if document retrieval is required

**üîç Step 2 - Retrieval**  
- Action: Searching OSFI documents for: "minimum CET1 ratio"
- Reasoning: Semantic search will find relevant regulatory sections

#### ü§ñ Regulatory Guidance
[Complete regulatory guidance with OSFI references]
```

## Performance Tips

1. **Virtual Environment**: Always use the Python virtual environment
2. **API Key**: Ensure Google API key is configured in config file
3. **Question Quality**: Well-formed questions get better reasoning visibility
4. **Batch Size**: Process 10-20 questions at a time for optimal performance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Import Error:**
```bash
# Ensure you're in the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**API Key Error:**
```bash
# Check config file has api_key_gemini=YOUR_KEY
cat config
```

**Memory Issues:**
- Reduce batch size
- Clear conversation history between runs
- Monitor system resources

### Error Recovery

If analysis fails for some questions:
- Check the generated report for error details
- Re-run with individual questions to isolate issues
- Verify PDF documents are accessible

## Integration

### CI/CD Integration
```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Run OSFI Analysis
  run: |
    source .venv/bin/activate
    python osfi_batch_analysis.py -q compliance_questions.txt -o reports/monthly_analysis.md
```

### Automated Reporting
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Monthly compliance check
DATE=$(date +%Y-%m)
python osfi_batch_analysis.py \
  -q monthly_questions.txt \
  -o "reports/osfi_analysis_${DATE}.md" \
  -t "OSFI CAR Monthly Analysis - ${DATE}"
```
