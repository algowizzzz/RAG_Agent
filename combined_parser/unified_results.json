The CAR Guideline is not made pursuant to subsections 485(2) or 949(2) of the BA, or \nto subsection 473(2) of the TLCA. However, the capital standards set out in this guideline \ntogether with the leverage requirements set out in the Leverage Requirements Guideline provide \nthe framework within which the Superintendent assesses whether a bank, a bank holding \ncompany, a trust company, or a loan company maintains adequate capital pursuant to the Acts. \nFor this purpose, the Superintendent has established two minimum standards: the leverage ratio \ndescribed in the Leverage Requirements Guideline, and the risk-based capital ratio described in \nthis guideline.\n1 The first test provides an overall measure of the adequacy of an institution's \ncapital. The second measure focuses on risk faced by the institution. Notwithstanding that a \nbank, bank holding company, trust company, or loan company may meet these standards, the \nSuperintendent may direct a bank or bank holding company to increase its capital under \nsubsections 485(3) or 949(3) of the BA, or a trust company or a loan company to increase its \ncapital under subsection 473(3) of the TLCA. \n \nOSFI, as a member of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, participated in the \ndevelopment of the Basel capital framework on which this guideline is based. Where relevant, \nthe Basel framework paragraph numbers are provided in square brackets at the end of each \nparagraph referencing material from the Basel framework.  \n \n1    The capital and leverage requirements for domestic systemically important banks are supplemented by the \nrequirements described in OSFI’s Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) Guideline .",

Under the IRB approaches, exposure at default (EAD) is determined gross of all specific \nallowances. The amount used in the calculation of EAD should normally be based on book \nvalue, except for the following where EAD should be based on amortized cost: \n• loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge; and \n• debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensive Income. \n \n11. Under the standardized approach, on-balance sheet exposures should normally be \nmeasured at book value, except the following where exposures should be measured at amortized \ncost: \n• loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge;  \n• debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensive Income; and \n• own-use property, plant and equipment \n \n12. For own-use property that is accounted for using the revaluation model, reported \nexposures should be based on an adjusted book value that reverses the impact of: \n• the balance of any revaluation surplus included in Other Comprehensive Income; and \n• accumulated net after-tax revaluation losses that are reflected in retained earnings or as a \nresult of subsequent revaluations \n \n13. The approaches listed in paragraph 8 specify how institutions should measure the size of \ntheir exposures (i.e. EAD) and determine their RWA. Certain types of transactions in the \nbanking book and trading book (such as derivatives and securities financial transactions) give \nrise to counterparty credit risk, for which the measurement of the size of the exposure can be \ncomplex. Therefore, the approaches listed in paragraph 8 include, or cross refer to, the following \nmethods available to determine the size of the counterparty exposures (refer to section 7.1 of \nChapter 7 for an overview of the counterparty credit risk requirements including the types of \ntransactions to which the methods below can be applied): \n \n6 This includes assets and liabilities booked outside of Canada as well as assets and liabilities of non -residents \nbooked in Canada.",

Institutions must receive explicit prior approval from OSFI in order to use any of the \nfollowing model-based approaches for regulatory capital purposes: the Foundation and \nAdvanced IRB Approaches to credit risk, the IMM to counterparty credit risk, and the Internal \nModels Approach (IMA) to market risk. The steps involved in the application for approval of \nthese approaches are outlined in OSFI Implementation Notes.  \n \n22.

Capital Floor–Internal Model Based Approaches \n \n27. To reduce excessive variability of RWA and to enhance the comparability of risk-based \ncapital ratios, institutions using internal model-based approaches for credit risk, counterparty \ncredit risk, or market risk are subject to a floor requirement that is applied to RWA. The capital \nfloor ensures that institutions’ capital requirements do not fall below a certain percentage of \ncapital requirements derived under standardized approaches. The calculation of the floor is set \nout below for institutions that have implemented the IRB approach for credit risk, IMM for \ncounterparty credit risk, or IMA for market risk. Institutions that have only implemented the \nstandardized approaches for credit risk, counterparty credit risk, and market risk are not subject \nto the capital floor. \n \nInstitutions that have implemented one of the internal model-based approaches for credit risk, \ncounterparty credit risk, or market risk must calculate the difference between: \ni. the capital floor as defined in section 1.5.1, and \nii. an adjusted capital requirement as defined in section 1.5.2. \n[Basel Framework, RBC 20.11] \n \n28. If the capital floor amount is larger than the adjusted capital requirement (i.e. the \ndifference is positive), institutions are required to add the difference to the total RWAs otherwise \ncalculated under this guideline. This adjusted RWA figure must be used as the denominator in \nthe calculation of the risk-based capital ratios. \n \n1.5.1. The Capital Floor \n \n29. The base of the capital floor includes the standardized approaches to credit risk and \noperational risk as described in paragraphs 31 through 35. The specific approach for market risk \nis described in paragraph 33. The capital floor is derived by applying an adjustment factor to the \nnet total of the following amounts: \ni. total risk-weighted assets for the capital floor, less \nii. 12.5 times the amount of any general allowance that may be recognized in Tier 2 capital \nfollowing the standardized approach methodology as outlined in Chapter 2 of this \nguideline.",

Total risk-weighted assets are determined by multiplying the capital requirements for \nmarket risk and operational risk by 12.5 and adding the resulting figures to risk-weighted assets \nfor credit risk. The capital ratios are calculated by dividing regulatory capital by total risk-\nweighted assets. The three ratios measure CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital adequacy and are \ncalculated as follows: \nRisk Based Capital Ratios =  𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶\n𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅  \n \nWhere: \nCapital = CET1, Tier 1, or Total capital as set out in Chapter 2. \nRWA = Risk-weighted assets, calculated as described in paragraph 7. \n \n39.

When buffers have been drawn down, there is a range of actions that can be taken to \nrebuild buffers including reducing discretionary distributions of earnings. This could include \nreducing dividends or other discretionary payments on shares or other capital instruments, share \nbuy-backs and, to the extent they are discretionary, staff bonus payments.\n12 Institutions may also \nchoose to raise new capital from the private sector as an alternative to conserving internally \ngenerated capital. Should buffers be drawn down, institutions should implement a capital \nrestoration plan for rebuilding buffers within a reasonable timeframe or, where the breach is \nexpected to be corrected promptly, a plan that provides assurance that the capital conservation \nbuffer will be restored on a sustained basis. The capital restoration plan should be discussed with \nOSFI as part of the capital planning process. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.21] \n \n45.

The distribution constraints \nincrease as institutions’ capital levels approach the minimum requirements. By design, the \nconstraints imposed on institutions with capital levels at the top of the range would be minimal. \nThis reflects an expectation that institutions’ capital levels may fall into this range from time to \ntime. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.2 and 30.3] \n \n49. Table 5 sets out the minimum capital conservation ratios an institution must meet at \nvarious levels of CET1 capital.\n14 The applicable conservation ratio must be recalculated at each \ndistribution date. Once imposed, conservation ratios will remain in place until such time as capital \nratios have been restored. If an institution wants to make payments in excess of the constraints set \nout in Table 5, sufficient capital must be raised in the private sector to fully compensate for the \nexcess distribution. This alternative should be discussed with OSFI as part of an institution’s \nInternal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). For the purposes of determining the \nminimum capital conservation ratio, the CET1 ratio includes amounts used to meet the 4.5% \nminimum CET1 requirement, but excludes any additional CET1 needed to meet the 6% Tier 1 and \n8% Total Capital requirements, as well as any CET1 capital needed to meet D-SIBs’ Total Loss \nAbsorbing Capacity (TLAC) requirements where applicable. For example, an institution with 8% \nCET1 and no Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital would meet all minimum capital requirements, but \nwould have a 0% capital conservation buffer and therefore be subject to the 100% constraint on \ncapital distributions. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4] \n \nTable 5: Minimum capital conservation ratios for corresponding levels of CET1 \nCET1 Ratio Minimum Capital Conservation Ratios (expressed as percentage \nof earnings) \n4.5% - 5.125% 100% \n>5.125% - 5.75% 80% \n>5.75% - 6.375% 60% \n>6.375% - 7.0% 40% \n>7.0% 0% \n \n50. If an institution’s capital ratio falls below the levels set out in Table 4, capital \nconservation ratios will be imposed that automatically limit distributions. As outlined in Table 5, \nthese limits increase as an institution’s capital levels approach the minimum requirements. For \nexample, an institution with a CET1 capital ratio in the range of 5.125% to 5.75% would be \nrequired to maintain the equivalent of 80% of its earnings in the subsequent payment period (i.e. \npay out no more than 20% in capital distributions). For clarity, where an institution’s disclosed \nratio is within the ranges where restrictions apply, distributions for the following payment period \nwill be constrained based on the most recently reported ratio irrespective of the current capital \nposition of the institution. Restrictions will remain in place until the capital conservation buffer \nis restored. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4] \n \n \n14  Similar capital conservation ratios apply where an institution breaches its Tier 1 capital or Total capital \nrequirements. In the event that an institution simultaneously breaches more than one capital requirement (e.g. 7% \nCET1, 8.5% Tier 1, 10.5% Total capital) it must apply the most constraining capital conservation ratio.",

Based on this assessment, a countercyclical buffer requirement, \nranging from 0% to 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets,\n18 will be put in place when \n \n15  SAC is a non-statutory body chaired by the Deputy Minister of Finance. Its membership is the same as the \nFinancial Institutions Supervisory Committee (“FISC”), i.e. OSFI, the Department of Finance, the Bank of \nCanada, the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada. The SAC \noperates as a consultative body and provides a forum for policy discussion on issues pertaining to the financial \nsector.  \n16  The document entitled Guidance for national authorities operating the countercyclical capital buffer , sets out the \nprinciples that national authorities have agreed to follow in making buffer decisions. This document provides \ninformation that should help institutions to understand and anticipate the buffer decisions made by national \nauthorities in the jurisdictions to which they have credit exposures.

OSFI \nregulated deposit-taking institutions who are subsidiaries of an OSFI regulated deposit-taking institution are not \nsubject to the countercyclical buffer. \n27   The pre-announced buffer decision and actual buffer in place will be published on the BIS website.  \n28   For Category III SMSBs, the countercyclical buffer would be applied as a % of [Adjusted Total Assets + RWA \nOperational Risk]. \n29  Annex 1 contains additional details around OSFI’s process for designating Canadian institutions as D -SIBs. \n30   BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.1 to 40.6 \n31  Similar capital conservation ratios apply where a D-SIB breaches its Tier 1 capital or Total capital requirements. \nIn the event that a D-SIB simultaneously breaches more than one capital requirement (e.g. 8% CET1, 9.5% Tier \n1, 11.5% Total Capital) it must apply the most constraining capital conservation ratio.",

In addition to the DSB, D-SIBs may be required \nto hold further Pillar II capital, as warranted, to address idiosyncratic or systemic risks that are \nnot adequately captured by the Pillar I requirements and buffers.

D-SIBs should take into account the DSB in their internal capital planning process. \nAdditionally, D-SIBs should report the DSB in their quarterly public disclosures, and include a \nbrief narrative on any changes to the buffer level. Breaches of the buffer by an individual D-SIB \nwill require public disclosure pursuant to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). \n \n71. The specific vulnerabilities covered by the DSB are expected to evolve over time, as they \nare based on current market conditions in combination with forward-looking expectations around \nthe materialization of risks to key vulnerabilities, and will be communicated as part of the semi-\nannual DSB level-setting announcements. The decision to include a vulnerability will be based \non whether it is measurable, material, cyclical and has a system-wide impact that could \nmaterialize in the foreseeable future.  \n \n72. OSFI will undertake a review of the buffer on a semi-annual basis, and any changes to \nthe buffer will be made public, in June and December, along with supporting rationale. In \nexceptional circumstances, OSFI may make and announce adjustments to the buffer in-between \nscheduled review dates. Transparency in setting the DSB will support institutions’ ability to use \nthis capital in times of stress by improving the understanding of the purpose of the buffer and \nhow it should be used.  \n \n73. Decreases of the buffer may occur in a situation when OSFI identifies that D-SIBs’ \nexposures to the vulnerabilities have diminished or that risks have materialized. In the latter case, \na decrease would be intended to allow D-SIBs to continue to provide loans and services to credit \nworthy households and businesses and/or to incur losses without breaching their capital targets. \nIncreases to the buffer may occur when OSFI is of the view that it would be prudent for D-SIBs \nto hold additional capital to protect against the identified vulnerabilities. Increases will be subject \nto a phase-in period; decreases will be effective immediately. \n \n1. 10. Capital Targets \n \n74. In addition to the minimum capital requirements described in section 1.6, OSFI expects \nall institutions to maintain target capital ratios equal to or greater than the minimum capital ratios \nplus the conservation buffer.\n35 For SMSBs, this means target ratios of at least 7% for CET1, \n8.5% for Tier 1 and 10.5% for Total capital. D-SIBs are expected to maintain target capital ratios \nequal to or greater than the minimum capital ratios plus the sum of the conservation buffer, the \nD-SIB surcharge and the DSB. For D-SIBs, this equates to target ratios of least 8% for CET1, \n9.5% for Tier 1, and 11.5% for Total capital plus the DSB.36 The target capital ratios for SMSBs \nand D-SIBs are summarized below in Table 8 below and illustrated in Annex 2.  \n \n \n \n \n \n35   The conservation buffer is the sum of the 2.5% capital conservation buffer plus any countercyclical buffer add-\nons, where applicable. \n36   As an example, where the DSB is set to 2% of RWA, D-SIBs’ target capital ratios would be at least 10% for \nCET1, 11.5% for Tier 1 and 13.5% for Total capital. This reflects a conservation buffer of 2.5% and a D -SIB \nsurcharge of 1.0%.",

The framework39 for dealing with D-SIBs set out by the BCBS indicates that domestic \nsystemic importance should be assessed with reference to the impact that an institution’s failure \ncould have on the domestic economy. Further, it notes that this assessment should consider \ninstitution-specific characteristics of systemic importance, such as size, inter-connectedness and \nsubstitutability, which are correlated with the systemic impact of failure. Accordingly, OSFI’s \nassessment of domestic systemic importance for Canadian institutions considers a range of \nindicators such as asset size, intra-financial claims and liabilities, and an institution’s roles in \ndomestic financial markets and in financial infrastructures. This section describes OSFI’s \ninferences from various measures of systemic importance.  \n \nSize  \n \n2. In general, an institution’s distress or failure is more likely to damage the Canadian \nfinancial system or economy if its activities comprise a large share of domestic banking activity. \nWhen Canadian institutions are compared according to their size as measured by total \nconsolidated assets, and by place of booking of assets, that is, according to whether the assets are \nbooked in Canada or abroad, the data show that: \n• the largest six banks account for more than 90% total banking assets; \n• the differences among the largest banks are smaller if only domestic assets are \nconsidered; and \n• relative systemic importance declines rapidly after the top five banks and after the \nsixth bank.  \n \nInter-connections \n \n3. The more inter-connected an institution is to other financial institutions, the greater is the \npotential for the failure of that institution to transmit problems throughout the financial system \nand to the broader economy. As a result, measurements of inter-connectedness also inform \ninstitutions’ systemic importance. Comparing Canadian institutions according to measures of \nintra-financial assets (i.e. claims on other financial institutions) and intra-financial liabilities (i.e. \nobligations to other financial institutions) again points to the dominance of the largest Canadian \nbanks. The rank-ordering among these banks, however, depends on the specific inter-\nconnectedness measure under consideration.   \n \nSubstitutability \n \n4. The systemic impact of an institution’s distress or failure is greater the less easily it can \nbe replaced as both a market participant and a financial service provider. As a result, OSFI’s \nidentification of D-SIBs also takes into account the types of roles that institutions play in \ndomestic financial markets and in domestic financial infrastructures, which inform views \nregarding substitutability. For example, this includes underwriter rankings in Canadian financial \n \n39  A framework for dealing with domestic systemically important banks (BCBS: October 2012)",

The largest \nbanks are also the dominant participants in CDSX, the clearing and settlement system for \nsecurities transactions in Canada. Some large Canadian banks also play key roles as members of \nthe CLS Bank, the global institution that settles foreign exchange transactions between banks in \nCanadian dollars and other major currencies.41 For example, the Royal Bank of Canada and the \nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce are the key Canadian-dollar liquidity providers for \nsettling Canadian dollar foreign exchange transactions through the CLS network. \n \n5. A variety of additional information has been assessed and recurring themes across the \nrange of evidence are the following:  \n• The five largest banks are by far the dominant banks in Canada, and consistently play \ncentral roles in a range of activities in the Canadian financial system; and   \n• The rank-order importance of the largest banks, as well as the relative differences \nbetween them, varies somewhat according to the measure considered.   \n \n6. This suggests that there are strong grounds for treating these banks in the same way, \nrather than relying on arbitrary weights to develop a single index of systemic importance. \nFurther, distinguishing reliably between the adverse effects on the Canadian economy from \nindividual D-SIB failures is largely moot, given the difficulty of credibly differentiating between \nthe large adverse impacts on the Canadian economy from the failure of any one of the largest \nbanks. This also argues against making distinctions between identified Canadian D-SIBs to \nassign degrees of systemic importance.\n  \n \n7. Given these various considerations, the Canadian D-SIBs are judged to be Bank of \nMontreal, The Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank of \nCanada, and The Toronto-Dominion Bank, without further distinction between them. National \nBank of Canada has also been designated as a D-SIB given its importance relative to other less \nprominent banks and in the interest of prudence given the inherent challenges in identifying \nahead of time which banks are likely to be systemic in times of stress. The designation of D-SIB \nstatus will be periodically reviewed and updated as needed.  \n \nHigher Loss Absorbency Targets \n \n8. The goal of a higher loss absorbency target is to reduce further the probability of failure \nof a D-SIB relative to non-systemic institutions, reflecting the greater impact that a D-SIB failure \nmay have on the domestic financial system and the economy. This surcharge takes into account \nthe structure of the Canadian financial system, the importance of large banks to the financial \narchitecture, and the expanded regulatory toolkit required to resolve a troubled financial \n \n40   ACSS handles all Canadian dollar payments not processed by the LVTS. \n41  CLS Bank provides a real-time global network that links a number of national payments systems to settle the \nforeign exchange transactions of its member banks",

The BCBS D-SIB framework provides for national discretion to accommodate \ncharacteristics of the domestic financial system and other local features, including the domestic \npolicy framework. The additional capital surcharge for banks designated as systemically \nimportant provides credible additional loss absorbency given: \n• extreme loss events as a percentage of RWA among this peer group over the past 25 \nyears would be less than the combination of the CET1 (2.5%) capital conservation \nbuffer and an additional 1%; and \n• current business models of the six largest banks are generally less exposed to the fat \ntailed risks associated with investment banking than some international peers, and the \nsix largest banks have a greater reliance on retail funding models compared to \nwholesale funding than some international peers – features that proved beneficial in \nlight of the experience of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. \nFrom a forward-looking perspective: \n• Canadian D-SIBs that hold capital at current targets plus a 1% surcharge (i.e. 8%) \nshould be able to weather a wide range of severe but plausible shocks without \nbecoming non-viable; and  \n• the higher loss absorbency in a crisis scenario achieved by the conversion to common \nequity) of the 2% to 3% in Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 NVCC capital instruments \npromoted by Basel III also adds to the resiliency of banks.  \n \nRelationship with Basel Committee G-SIB Framework \n \n9. OSFI has adopted the Basel Committee’s framework on the assessment methodology for \nG-SIBs. The assessment methodology for G-SIBs follows an indicator-based approach agreed by \nthe BCBS that will determine which institutions are to be designated as G-SIBs and subject to \nadditional loss absorbency requirements that range from 1% to 3.5% RWA, depending on an \ninstitution's global systemic importance.\n42 For Canadian D-SIBs that are also designated as G-\nSIBs, the higher of the D-SIB and G-SIB surcharges will apply.43  \n \nSupervisory Implications \n \n10. Canadian D-SIBs are expected to have advanced practices in terms of the design and \noperation of oversight functions and internal controls. OSFI expects these practices to continue \nto improve as supervision becomes more intensive and international best practices evolve. The \ninstitutions designated as D-SIBs have historically had, and will continue to be subject to, more \nintensive supervision because of their larger size, broader and more complex business models \nand consequently more significant risk profiles. The principles of risk based supervisory \nintensity are reflected in OSFI’s Supervisory Framework.\n44 The Framework is applied on a \nconsolidated basis to all Canadian institutions and requires OSFI supervisors to determine the \n \n42   BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.1 to 40.6 and SCO 40.1 to 50.20  \n43   Details related to G-SIB’s annual public disclosure requirements are included in OSFI’s Global Systemically \nImportant Banks – Public Disclosure Requirements Advisory    \n44  OSFI’s Supervisory Framework (OSFI: February 2011)",

This chapter is drawn from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) Basel \nframework, published on the BIS website,1 effective December 15, 2019. For reference, the \nBasel paragraph numbers that are associated with the text appearing in this chapter are \nindicated in square brackets at the end of each paragraph.\n2 \n \n7.1. Treatment of counterparty credit risk and cross-product netting \n \n2. This rule identifies permissible methods for estimating the Exposure at Default (EAD) \nor the exposure amount for instruments with counterparty credit risk under this guideline.\n3  \nInstitutions may seek OSFI approval to make use of an Internal Modelling Method (IMM) \nmeeting the requirements and specifications identified herein. As an alternative institutions may \nalso use the Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR). [Basel Framework, \nCRE 53.1] \n7.1.1 Definitions and general terminology \n3. This section defines terms that will be used throughout this chapter. \n \n7.1.1.1 General terms \n \n• Counterparty Credit Risk (CCR) is the risk that the counterparty to a transaction could \ndefault before the final settlement of the transaction's cash flows. An economic loss \nwould occur if the transactions or portfolio of transactions with the counterparty has a \npositive economic value at the time of default. Unlike an institution’s exposure to credit \nrisk through a loan, where the exposure to credit risk is unilateral and only the lending \ninstitution faces the risk of loss, CCR creates a bilateral risk of loss: the market value of \nthe transaction can be positive or negative to either counterparty to the transaction. The \nmarket value is uncertain and can vary over time with the movement of underlying \nmarket factors. \n• A central counterparty (CCP) is a clearing house that interposes itself between \ncounterparties to contracts traded in one or more financial markets, becoming the buyer \nto every seller and the seller to every buyer and thereby ensuring the future performance \nof open contracts. A CCP becomes a counterparty to trades with market participants \nthrough novation, an open offer system, or another legally binding arrangement. For the \npurposes of the capital framework, a CCP is a financial institution.   \n• A qualifying central counterparty (QCCP) is an entity that is licensed to operate as a \nCCP (including a license granted by way of confirming an exemption), and is permitted \nby the appropriate regulator/overseer to operate as such with respect to the products \n \n1    The Basel Framework  \n2  Following the format: [Basel Framework XXX yy.zz]. \n3 In this document, the terms “exposure at default” and “exposure amount” are used together in order to identify \nmeasures of exposure under both an internal ratings-based (IRB) and a standardized approach for credit risk.",

This is subject to the provision that the CCP is based and prudentially supervised \nin a jurisdiction where the relevant regulator/overseer has established, and publicly \nindicated that it applies to the CCP on an ongoing basis, domestic rules and regulations \nthat are consistent with the CPSS-IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures. \nWhere the CCP is in a jurisdiction that does not have a CCP regulator applying the \nPrinciples to the CCP, then OSFI may make the determination of whether the CCP meets \nthis definition.  \nIn addition, for a CCP to be considered as a QCCP, the requirements in paragraph 204 \nmust be met to permit each clearing member institution to calculate its capital \nrequirement for its default fund contributions.  \n• A clearing member is a member of, or a direct participant in, a CCP that is entitled to \nenter into a transaction with the CCP, regardless of whether it enters into trades with a \nCCP for its own hedging, investment or speculative purposes or whether it also enters \ninto trades as a financial intermediary between the CCP and other market participants.\n4  \n• A client is a party to a transaction with a CCP through either a clearing member acting as \na financial intermediary, or a clearing member guaranteeing the performance of the client \nto the CCP.  \n• Initial margin means a clearing member’s or client’s funded collateral posted to the CCP \nto mitigate the potential future exposure of the CCP to the clearing member arising from \nthe possible future change in the value of their transactions. For the purposes of the \ncalculation of counterparty credit risk capital requirements, initial margin does not \ninclude contributions to a CCP for mutualized loss sharing arrangements (i.e., in case a \nCCP uses initial margin to mutualize losses among the clearing members, it will be \ntreated as a default fund exposure). Initial margin may include excess collateral, in cases \nwhere the CCP may prevent the clearing member and the clearing member may prevent \nthe client from withdrawing the excess.   \n• Variation margin means a clearing member’s or client’s funded collateral posted on a \ndaily or intraday basis to a CCP based upon price movements of their transactions.  \n• Trade exposures (in section 7.1.8) include the current\n5 and potential future exposure of a \nclearing member or a client to a CCP arising from OTC derivatives, exchange traded \nderivatives transactions or securities financing transactions (SFTs), as well as initial \nmargin.  \n• Default funds, also known as clearing deposits or guaranty fund contributions (or any \nother names), are clearing members’ funded or unfunded contributions towards, or \nunderwriting of, a CCP’s mutualized loss sharing arrangements.

Whether the second CCP’s collateral contribution t o the first CCP is treated as \ninitial margin or a default fund contribution will depend upon the legal arrangement between the CCPs. OSFI \nshould be consulted to determine the treatment of this initial margin and default fund contributions.    \n5  For the purposes of this definition, the current exposure of a clearing member includes the variation margin due \nto the clearing member but not yet received.",

Margin lending \ntransactions do not include other loans that happen to be secured by securities collateral. \nGenerally, in margin lending transactions, the loan amount is collateralized by securities \nwhose value is greater than the amount of the loan. \n[Basel Framework, CRE 50.14] \n \n7.1.1.3 Netting sets, hedging sets, and related terms \n \n• Netting Set is a group of transactions with a single counterparty that are subject to a \nlegally enforceable bilateral netting arrangement and for which netting is recognized for \nregulatory capital purposes under Chapter 4 or the Cross-Product Netting Rules set forth \nin this chapter. Each transaction that is not subject to a legally enforceable bilateral \nnetting arrangement that is recognized for regulatory capital purposes should be \ninterpreted as its own netting set for the purpose of these rules. \n• Hedging Set is a set of transactions within a single netting set within which full or partial \noffsetting is recognized for purposes of calculating the potential future exposure (PFE) \nadd-on of the SA-CCR. .",

Current exposure is often also called Replacement Cost.  \n• Peak Exposure is a high percentile (typically 95% or 99%) of the distribution of \nexposures at any particular future date before the maturity date of the longest transaction \nin the netting set. A peak exposure value is typically generated for many future dates up \nuntil the longest maturity date of transactions in the netting set. \n• Expected Exposure is the mean (average) of the distribution of exposures at any \nparticular future date before the longest-maturity transaction in the netting set matures. \nAn expected exposure value is typically generated for many future dates up until the \nlongest maturity date of transactions in the netting set. \n• Effective Expected Exposure at a specific date is the maximum expected exposure that \noccurs at that date or any prior date. Alternatively, it may be defined for a specific date as \nthe greater of the expected exposure at that date, or the effective exposure at the previous \ndate. In effect, the Effective Expected Exposure is the Expected Exposure that is \nconstrained to be non-decreasing over time. \n• Expected Positive Exposure (EPE) is the weighted average over time of expected \nexposures where the weights are the proportion that an individual expected exposure \nrepresents of the entire time interval. When calculating the minimum capital requirement, \nthe average is taken over the first year or, if all the contracts in the netting set mature \nbefore one year, over the time period of the longest-maturity contract in the netting set.  \n• Effective Expected Positive Exposure (Effective EPE) is the weighted average over \ntime of effective expected exposure over the first year, or, if all the contracts in the \nnetting set mature before one year, over the time period of the longest-maturity contract \nin the netting set where the weights are the proportion that an individual expected \nexposure represents of the entire time interval.  \n• Credit Valuation Adjustment is an adjustment to the mid-market valuation of the \nportfolio of trades with a counterparty. This adjustment reflects the market value of the \ncredit risk due to any failure to perform on contractual agreements with a counterparty. \nThis adjustment may reflect the market value of the credit risk of the counterparty or the \nmarket value of the credit risk of both the institution and the counterparty.  \n• One-Sided Credit Valuation Adjustment is a credit valuation adjustment that reflects \nthe market value of the credit risk of the counterparty to the firm, but does not reflect the \nmarket value of the credit risk of the institution to the counterparty. \n• Debit Valuation Adjustment is a valuation adjustment that reflects the market value of \nthe credit risk of the institution to the counterparty (i.e. changes in the reporting \ninstitution’s own credit risk), but does not reflect the market value of the credit risk of the \ncounterparty to the institution.

[Basel Framework, CRE 51.7] \n8. For exposures that are not cleared through a central counterparty (CCP) the following \nmethods must be used to calculate the counterparty credit risk exposure:  \n(1) The standardized approach for measuring counterparty credit risk exposures (SA-CCR), \nwhich is set out in section 7.1.7. This method is to be used for exposures arising from OTC \nderivatives, exchange-traded derivatives and long settlement transactions. This method must be \nused if the bank does not have approval to use the internal model method (IMM).  \n(2) The simple approach or comprehensive approach to the recognition of collateral, which are \nboth set out in the credit risk mitigation section of the standardized approach to credit risk (see \nChapter 4, section 4.3). These methods are to be used for securities financing transactions (SFTs) \nand must be used if the bank does not have approval to use the value-at-risk (VaR) models or the \nIMM.  \n \n7    The terms “exposure” and “EAD” are used interchangably in the counterparty credit risk chapters of the credit \nrisk standard. This reflects the fact that the amounts calculated under the counterparty credit risk rules must \ntypically be used as either the “exposure” within the standardized approach to credit risk, or the EAD within the \ninternal ratings-based (IRB) approach to credit risk, as described in paragraph 13.",

The stress \ncalibration should be a single consistent stress calibration for the whole portfolio of \ncounterparties. The greater of Effective EPE using current market data and the stress calibration \nshould be applied on a total portfolio level and not on a counterparty by counterparty basis. \n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.7] \n \n22.

If the netting set is subject to a margin agreement and the internal model captures the \neffects of margining when estimating EE, the model’s EE measure may be used directly in \nequation (2). Such models are noticeably more complicated than models of EPE for unmargined \ncounterparties. As such, they are subject to a higher degree of supervisory scrutiny before they \nare approved, as discussed below.  [Basel Framework, CRE 53.22] \n \n39. An EPE model must also include transaction-specific information in order to capture the \neffects of margining. It must take into account both the current amount of margin and margin \nthat would be passed between counterparties in the future. Such a model must account for the \nnature of margin agreements (unilateral or bilateral), the frequency of margin calls, the margin \nperiod of risk, the thresholds of unmargined exposure the institution is willing to accept, and the \nminimum transfer amount. Such a model must either model the mark-to-market change in the \nvalue of collateral posted or apply this guideline’s rules for collateral.  [Basel Framework, CRE \n53.23] \n \n40. For transactions subject to daily re-margining and mark-to-market valuation, a \nsupervisory floor of five business days for netting sets consisting only of repo-style transactions, \nand 10 business days for all other netting sets is imposed on the margin period of risk used for \nthe purpose of modelling EAD with margin agreements. In the following cases a higher \nsupervisory floor is imposed: \n \n11  Conceptually, M equals the effective credit duration of the counterparty exposure.

The internal model used to generate the distribution of exposures must be part of a \ncounterparty risk management framework that includes the identification, measurement, \nmanagement, approval and internal reporting of counterparty risk.\n13 This framework must \ninclude the measurement of usage of credit lines (aggregating counterparty exposures with other \ncredit exposures) and economic capital allocation. In addition to EPE (a measure of future \nexposure), an institution must measure and manage current exposures. Where appropriate, the \ninstitution must measure current exposure gross and net of collateral held. The use test is \nsatisfied if an institution uses other counterparty risk measures, such as peak exposure or \npotential future exposure (PFE), based on the distribution of exposures generated by the same \nmodel to compute EPE. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.42] \n \n60. An institution is not required to estimate or report EE daily, but to meet the use test it \nmust have the systems capability to estimate EE daily, if necessary, unless it demonstrates to \nOSFI that its exposures to CCR warrant some less frequent calculation. It must choose a time \nprofile of forecasting horizons that adequately reflects the time structure of future cash flows and \nmaturity of the contracts. For example, an institution may compute EE on a daily basis for the \nfirst 10 days, once a week out to one month, once a month out to 18 months, once a quarter out \nto five years and beyond five years in a manner that is consistent with the materiality and \ncomposition of the exposure. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.43] \n \n61. Exposure must be measured out to the life of all contracts in the netting set (not just to \nthe one-year horizon), monitored and controlled. The institution must have procedures in place to \nidentify and control the risks for counterparties where exposure rises beyond the one-year \nhorizon. Moreover, the forecasted increase in exposure must be an input into the firm’s internal \neconomic capital model. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.44] \n \nStress testing \n \n62. An institution must have in place sound stress testing processes for use in the \nassessment of capital adequacy. These stress measures must be compared against the measure of \nEPE and considered by the institution as part of its internal capital adequacy assessment process. \nStress testing must also involve identifying possible events or future changes in economic \nconditions that could have unfavourable effects on a firm’s credit exposures and assessment of \nthe firm’s ability to withstand such changes. Examples of scenarios that could be used are; (i) \neconomic or industry downturns, (ii) market-place events, or (iii) decreased liquidity conditions. \n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.45] \n \n63. Institutions must have a comprehensive stress testing program for counterparty credit \nrisk.

Institutions must identify exposures that give rise to a greater degree of general wrong-\nway risk. Stress testing and scenario analyses must be designed to identify risk factors that are \npositively correlated with counterparty credit worthiness. Such testing needs to address the \npossibility of severe shocks occurring when relationships between risk factors have changed. \nInstitutions should monitor general wrong way risk by product, by region, by industry, or by \nother categories that are germane to the business. Reports should be provided to senior \nmanagement on a regular basis that communicate wrong way risks and the steps that are being \ntaken to manage that risk.  [Basel Framework, CRE 53.47] \n \n65. An institution is exposed to “specific wrong-way risk” (SWWR) if future exposure to a \nspecific counterparty is highly correlated with the counterparty’s probability of default. For \nexample, a company writing put options on its own stock creates wrong-way exposures for the \nbuyer that is specific to the counterparty. An institution must have procedures in place to \nidentify, monitor and control cases of SWWR, beginning at the inception of a trade and \ncontinuing through the life of the trade. To calculate the CCR capital charge, the instruments for \nwhich there exists a legal connection between the counterparty and the underlying issuer, and for \nwhich specific wrong way risk has been identified, are not considered to be in the same netting \nset as other transactions with the counterparty. Furthermore, for single-name credit default swaps \nwhere there exists a legal connection between the counterparty and the underlying issuer, and \nwhere SWWR has been identified, EAD in respect of such swap counterparty exposure equals \nthe full expected loss in the remaining fair value of the underlying instruments assuming the \nunderlying issuer is in liquidation. The use of the full expected loss in remaining fair value of the \nunderlying instrument allows the institution to recognize, in respect of such swap, the market \nvalue that has been lost already and any expected recoveries. Accordingly LGD for Advanced or \nFoundation IRB institutions must be set to 100% for such swap transactions.\n14 For institutions \nusing the standardized approach for credit risk, the risk weight to use is that of an unsecured \ntransaction. For equity derivatives, bond options, securities financing transactions etc. \nreferencing a single company where there exists a legal connection between the counterparty and \nthe underlying company, and where SWWR has been identified, EAD equals the value of the \ntransaction under the assumption of a jump-to-default of the underlying security. Inasmuch this \nmakes re-use of possibly existing (market risk) calculations (for IRC) that already contain an \nLGD assumption, the LGD must be set to 100%. LGD for Advanced and Foundation IRB banks \nwill be that of an unsecured exposure. For institutions using the standardized approach for credit \nrisk, the risk weight of an unsecured transaction should be used. \n \nThe counterparty credit risk arising from trades where SWWR has been identified can be \nmitigated through either prepayment or the collection of independent collateral amounts. If a \ncounterparty prepays the notional amount of the exposure for a trade where SWWR has been \n \n14  Note that the recoveries may also be possible on the underlying instrument beneath such swap. The capital \nrequirements for such underlying exposure are to be calculated without reduction for the swap which introduces \nwrong way risk. Generally this means that such underlying exposure will receive the risk weight and capital \ntreatment associated with an unsecured transaction (i.e. assuming such underlying exposure is an unsecured \ncredit exposure).",

Permitted trade types include: \n• An equity warrant, or option in each case written by the counterparty on the \ncounterparty’s own stock purchased as part of a call spread overlay transaction, where \na bond hedge has also been purchased. Call spread overlay transactions involve a \ncounterparty issuing convertible bonds and wishing to synthetically increase the \nconversion price. \n• Issuer forward as well as issuer range forward sales of equity whereby the institution \nhas also simultaneously shorted the shares of the counterparty. Issuer and issuer range \nforward sales of equity are typically done by a counterparty, with future capital \nexpenditures or other funding needs, wishing to lock in a favourable current stock \nprice or range of stock prices without needing to issue shares until the maturity of the \nforward or range forward transaction.  \n• Accelerated share repurchase agreements whereby counterparties provide an \ninstitution with funds to buy back shares in a defined period of time (typically under \nsix months). \n \n15 Trade types listed in paragraph 69 do not automatically qualify for a zero EAD.

The replacement cost (RC) and the PFE components are calculated differently for margined \nand unmargined netting sets. Margined netting sets are covered by a margin agreement under \nwhich the bank’s counterparty has to post variation margin; all other netting sets, including \nthose covered by a one-way margin agreement where only the bank posts variation margin, \nare treated as unmargined for the purposes of the SA-CCR.

There are two formulations of replacement cost depending on whether the trades with a \ncounterparty are subject to a margin agreement. Where a margin agreement exists, the \nformulation could apply both to bilateral transactions and central clearing relationships. The \nformulation also addresses the various arrangements that an institution may have to post and/or \nreceive collateral that may be referred to as initial margin. [Basel Framework, CRE 52.9] \n \nA. Formulation for unmargined transactions \n \n105. For unmargined transactions (that is, where VM is not exchanged, but collateral other \nthan VM may be present), RC is defined as the greater of: (i) the current market value of the \nderivative contracts less net haircut collateral held by the institution (if any), and (ii) zero. This is \nconsistent with the use of replacement cost as the measure of current exposure, meaning that \nwhen the institution owes the counterparty money it has no exposure to the counterparty if it can \ninstantly replace its trades and sell collateral at current market prices. Mathematically:   \n \nRC = max{V-C,0} \nwhere V is the value of the derivative transactions in the netting set and C is the haircut value of \nnet collateral held, which is calculated in accordance with the NICA methodology defined in \nparagraph 112. For this purpose, the value of non-cash collateral posted by the institution to its \ncounterparty is increased and the value of the non-cash collateral received by the institution from \nits counterparty is decreased using haircuts (which are the same as those that apply to repo-style \ntransactions) for the time periods described in paragraph 100.  \n[Basel Framework, CRE 52.10 and 52.11] \n \n106. In the above formulation, it is assumed that the replacement cost representing today’s \nexposure to the counterparty cannot go less than zero. However, institutions sometimes hold \nexcess collateral (even in the absence of a margin agreement) or have out-of-the-money trades \nwhich can further protect the institution from the increase of the exposure. As discussed in \nparagraphs 116 to 118, the SA-CCR would allow such over-collateralization and negative mark-\n \n22  Thus, if any of these supervisors is dissatisfied about enforceability under its laws, the netting contract or \nagreement will not meet this condition and neither counterparty could obtain supervisory benefit.",

The PFE component \nalso reflects the risk-reducing property of excess collateral. [Basel Framework, CRE 52.21] \n117. For prudential reasons and in line with Basel Committee direction, OSFI applied a \nmultiplier to the PFE component that decreases as excess collateral increases, without reaching \nzero (the multiplier is floored at 5% of the PFE add-on). When the collateral held is less than the \nnet market value of the derivative contracts (“under-collateralization”), the current replacement \ncost is positive and the multiplier is equal to one (i.e. the PFE component is equal to the full \nvalue of the aggregate add-on).

For more complex trades that may have more than one risk driver (e.g., multi-asset or \nhybrid derivatives), institutions must take sensitivities and volatility of the underlying into \naccount for determining the primary risk driver.  \nOSFI may also require more complex trades to be allocated to more than one asset class, \nresulting in the same position being included in multiple classes. In this case, for each asset class \nto which the position is allocated, institutions must determine appropriately the sign and delta \nadjustment of the relevant risk driver. \n[Basel Framework, CRE 52.27 and 52.28] \n \n7.1.7.6 General steps for calculating the add-on \n \n122. For each transaction, the primary risk factor or factors need to be determined and \nattributed to one or more of the five asset classes: interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, equity \nor commodity. The add-on for each asset class is calculated using asset-class-specific formulas \nthat represent a stylized Effective EPE calculation under the assumption that all trades in the \nasset class have zero current mark-to-market value (i.e. they are at-the-money). [Basel \nFramework, CRE 52.29] \n123. Although the add-on formulas are asset class-specific, they have a number of features in \ncommon. To determine the add-on, transactions in each asset class are subject to adjustment in \nthe following general steps: \n1) The effective notional (D) must be calculated for each derivative (i.e. each individual \ntrade) in the netting set. The effective notional is a measure of the sensitivity of the trade \nto movements in the underlying risk factors (i.e. interest rates, exchange rates, credit \nspreads, equity prices and commodity prices). The effective notional is calculated as the \nproduct of the following parameters (i.e. D = d × MF × δ): \na. The adjustment notional (d). The adjusted notional is a measure of the size of \nthe trade. For derivatives in the foreign exchange asset class this is simply the \nnotional value of the foreign currency leg of the derivative contracted, converted \nto the domestic currency. For derivatives in the equity and commodity asset \nclasses, it is simply the current price of the relevant share or unit of commodity \nmultiplied by the number of shares/units that the derivative references. For \nderivatives in the interest rate and credit asset classes, the notional amount is \nadjusted by a measure of the duration of the instrument to account for the fact that \nthe value of the instruments with longer durations are more sensitive to \nmovements in underlying risk factors (i.e. interest rates and credit spreads). \nb. The maturity factor (MF). The maturity factor is a parameter that takes account \nof the time period over which the potential future exposure is calculated. The \ncalculation of the maturity factor varies depending on whether the netting set is \nmargined or unmargined.  \nc. The supervisory delta (δ). The supervisory delta ensures the effective notional \ntakes into account the direction of the trade, i.e. whether the trade is long or short, \nby having a positive or negative sign. It is also takes into account whether the",

The \nsupervisory factor is the supervisory specified change in value of the underlying risk \nfactor on which the potential future exposure calculation is based, which has been \ncalibrated to take into account the volatility of underlying risk factors. \n3) The trades within each asset class are separated into supervisory specified hedging sets. \nThe purpose of the hedging sets is to group together trades within the netting set where \nlong and short positions should be permitted to offset each other in the calculation of the \npotential future exposure. \n4) Aggregation formulas are applied to aggregate the effective notionals and supervisory \nfactors across all trades within each hedging set and finally at the asset-class level to give \nthe asset class level add-on. The method of aggregation varies between assets classes and \nfor credit, equity and commodity derivatives. It also involves the application of \nsupervisory correlation parameters to capture diversification of the trades and basis risk. \n [Basel Framework, CRE 52.30] \n7.1.7.7 Time Period Parameters Mi, Ei, Si, and Ti \n124. Four time period parameters are used in the SA-CCR (all expressed in years): \n• For all asset classes, the maturity Mi of a contract is the time period (starting today) until \nthe latest day when the contract may still be active. This time period appears in the \nmaturity factor defined in paragraphs 139 to 144 that scales down adjusted notional for \nunmargined trades for all asset classes. If a derivative contract has another derivative \ncontract as its underlying (for example, a swaption) and may be physically exercised into \nthe underlying contract (i.e., an institution would assume a position in the underlying \ncontract in the event of exercise), then maturity of the contract is the time period until the \nfinal settlement date of the underlying derivative contract.  \n• For interest rate and credit derivatives, S\ni is the period of time (starting today) until the \nstart of the time period referenced by an interest rate or credit contract. If the derivative \nreferences the value of another interest rate or credit instrument (e.g., swaption or bond \noption), the time period must be determined on the basis of the underlying instrument. S\ni \nappears in the definition of supervisory duration defined in paragraph 126.  \n• For interest rate and credit derivatives, Ei is the period of time (starting today) until the \nend of the time period referenced by an interest rate or credit contract. If the derivative \nreferences the value of another interest rate or credit instrument (e.g., swaption or bond \noption), the time period must be determined on the basis of the underlying instrument. \nEi \nappears in the definition of supervisory duration defined in paragraph 126. In addition, Ei \nis used for allocating derivatives in the interest rate asset class to maturity buckets, which \nare used in the calculation of the add-on (see paragraph \n146).For options in all asset \nclasses, Ti is the time period (starting today) until the latest contractual exercise date as \nreferenced by the contract.

In many cases the trade notional amount is stated clearly and fixed until maturity. When \nthis is not the case, institutions must use the following rules to determine the trade notional \namount. \n• Where the notional is a formula of market values, the institution must enter the current \nmarket values to determine the trade notional amount.  \n• For all interest rate and credit derivatives with variable notional amounts specified in the \ncontract (such as amortizing and accreting swaps), institutions must use the average \nnotional over the remaining life of the swap as the trade notional amount. The average \nshould be calculated as “time weighted”. The averaging described in this paragraph does \nnot cover transactions where the notional varies due to price changes (typically FX, \nequity and commodity derivatives). \n• Leveraged swaps must be converted to the notional of the equivalent unleveraged swap, \nthat is, where all rates in a swap are multiplied by a factor, the stated notional must be \nmultiplied by the factor on the interest rates to determine the trade notional amount.  \n• For a derivative contract with multiple exchanges of principal, the notional is multiplied \nby the number of exchanges of principal in the derivative contract to determine the trade \nnotional amount.  \n• For a derivative contract that is structured such that on specified dates any outstanding \nexposure is settled and the terms are reset so that the fair value of the contract is zero, the \nremaining maturity equals the time until the next reset date.  \n \n26  There is a distinction between the time period of the underlying transaction and the remaining maturity of the \nderivative contract.

In the \ncase of Asian options, the underlying price must be set equal to the current value of the \naverage used in the payoff. In the case of American and Bermudan options, the latest \nallowed exercise date must be used as the exercise date \niT  in the formula.  \nFor Bermudan swaptions, the start date iS  must be equal to the earliest allowed exercise \ndate, while the end date iE  must be equal to the end date of the underlying swap. \n• For digital options (also known as binary options), the payoff of each digital option \n(bought or sold) with strike \niK  must be approximated via the “collar” combination of \nbought and sold European options of the same type (call or put) with the strikes set equal \nto \n0.95 iK⋅  and 1.05 iK⋅ . The size of the position in the collar components must be such \nthat the digital payoff is reproduced exactly outside of the region between the two strikes. \nThe effective notional is then computed for the bought and sold European components of \nthe collar separately, using the option formulas for the supervisory delta in paragraph 132 \n(the exercise date \niT  and the current value of the underlying iP  of the digital option must \nbe used). The absolute value of the digital option effective notional must be capped by the \nratio of the digital payoff to the relevant supervisory factor. \n• If a trade’s payoff can be represented as a combination of European option payoffs (e.g. \ncollar, butterfly/calendar spread, straddle, strangle, etc.), each European option \ncomponent must be treated as a separate trade. \n[Basel Framework, CRE 52.42] \n \n• \nFor the purposes of effective notional calculations, multi-payment options must be represented \nas a combination of single-payment options.

The entity level add-ons are allowed to offset each other fully in the \nsystemic component, whereas, there is no offsetting benefit in the idiosyncratic component. \nThese two components are weighted by a correlation factor which determines the degree of \noffsetting/hedging benefit within the credit derivative asset class. The higher the correlation \nfactor, the higher the importance of the systemic component, hence the higher the degree of \noffsetting benefits. [Basel Framework, CRE 52.62] \n \n153. It should be noted that a higher or lower correlation does not necessarily mean a higher \nor lower capital charge. For portfolios consisting of long and short credit positions, a high \ncorrelation factor would reduce the charge. For portfolios consisting exclusively of long \npositions (or short positions), a higher correlation factor would increase the charge. If most of the \nrisk consists of systematic risk, then individual reference entities would be highly correlated and \nlong and short positions should offset each other. If, however, most of the risk is idiosyncratic to \na reference entity, then individual long and short positions would not be effective hedges for \neach other. [Basel Framework, CRE 52.63] \n154. The use of a single hedging set for credit derivatives implies that credit derivatives from \ndifferent industries and regions are equally able to offset the systematic component of an \nexposure, although they would not be able to offset the idiosyncratic portion.

Net collateral \navailable to the institution should include both VM and NICA. Mathematically, RC for the entire \nmargin agreement is: \n𝑀𝑀𝑅𝑅𝑀𝑀𝐴𝐴 = 𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑎𝑚𝑚� � 𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑎𝑚𝑚{𝑉𝑉𝑁𝑁𝑆𝑆; 0} −𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑎𝑚𝑚{𝑅𝑅𝑀𝑀𝐴𝐴; 0}; 0\n𝑁𝑁𝑆𝑆∈𝑀𝑀𝐴𝐴\n�+ 𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑎𝑚𝑚� � 𝑚𝑚𝑑𝑑𝑚𝑚{𝑉𝑉𝑁𝑁𝑆𝑆; 0} −𝑚𝑚𝑑𝑑𝑚𝑚{𝑅𝑅𝑀𝑀𝐴𝐴; 0}; 0\n𝑁𝑁𝑆𝑆∈𝑀𝑀𝐴𝐴\n� \nwhere the summation 𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆 ∈ 𝑀𝑀𝐴𝐴is across the netting sets covered by the margin agreement \n(hence the notation), VNS is the current mark-to-market value of the netting set NS and CMA is the \ncash equivalent value of all currently available collateral under the margin agreement. \n[Basel Framework 52.75] \n \n167. Where a single margin agreement applies to several netting sets as described in \nparagraph 166, collateral will be exchanged based on mark-to-market values that are netted \nacross all transactions covered under the margin agreement, irrespective of netting sets. That is, \ncollateral exchanged on a net basis may not be sufficient to cover PFE. \nIn this situation, therefore, the PFE add-on must be calculated according to the unmargined \nmethodology. Netting set-level PFEs are then aggregated. Mathematically: \n𝑃𝑃𝐹𝐹𝐸𝐸\n𝑀𝑀𝐴𝐴 = � 𝑃𝑃𝐹𝐹𝐸𝐸𝑁𝑁𝑆𝑆\n(𝑛𝑛𝑑𝑑𝑛𝑛𝑎𝑎𝐹𝐹𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑎𝑎𝑑𝑑)\n𝑁𝑁𝑆𝑆∈𝑀𝑀𝐴𝐴\n \nwhere 𝑃𝑃𝐹𝐹𝐸𝐸𝑁𝑁𝑆𝑆\n(𝑛𝑛𝑑𝑑𝑛𝑛𝑎𝑎𝐹𝐹𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑎𝑎𝑑𝑑)is the PFE add-on for the netting set NS calculated according to the \nunmargined requirements. \n \nFor the calculation of the multiplier of the PFE of each individual netting set covered by a single \nmargin agreement or collateral amount, the available collateral C (which, in the case of a \nvariation margin agreement, includes variation margin posted or received) should be allocated to \nthe netting sets as follows: \n \n• If the institution is a net receiver of collateral (C>0), all of the individual amounts \nallocated to the individual netting sets must also be positive or zero. Netting sets with \npositive market values must first be allocated collateral up to the amount of those market \nvalues. Only after all positive market values have been compensated may surplus \ncollateral be attributed freely among all netting sets.",

Transactions settled through a delivery-versus-payment system (DvP),48 providing \nsimultaneous exchanges of securities for cash, expose firms to a risk of loss on the difference \nbetween the transaction valued at the agreed settlement price and the transaction valued at \ncurrent market price (i.e., positive current exposure). Transactions where cash is paid without \nreceipt of the corresponding receivable (securities, foreign currencies, gold, or commodities) or, \nconversely, deliverables were delivered without receipt of the corresponding cash payment (non-\nDvP, or free-delivery) expose firms to a risk of loss on the full amount of cash paid or \ndeliverables delivered. The current rules set out specific capital charges that address these two \nkinds of exposures.  [Basel Framework, CRE 70.3 and 70.4] \n \n213. The following capital treatment is applicable to all transactions on securities, foreign \nexchange instruments, and commodities that give rise to a risk of delayed settlement or delivery. \nThis includes transactions through recognized clearing houses and central counterparties that are \nsubject to daily mark-to-market and payment of daily variation margins and that involve a \nmismatched trade.\n49 The treatment does not apply to the instruments that are subject to the \ncounterparty credit risk requirements set out in section 7.1 or the credit risk mitigation section of \nchapter 4 of this guideline (i.e. over-the-counter derivatives, exchange-traded derivatives, long \nsettlement transactions, securities financing transactions).[Basel Framework, CRE 70.5]  \n \n214.

The CAR Guideline is not made pursuant to subsections 485(2) or 949(2) of the BA, or \nto subsection 473(2) of the TLCA. However, the capital standards set out in this guideline \ntogether with the leverage requirements set out in the Leverage Requirements Guideline provide \nthe framework within which the Superintendent assesses whether a bank, a bank holding \ncompany, a trust company, or a loan company maintains adequate capital pursuant to the Acts. \nFor this purpose, the Superintendent has established two minimum standards: the leverage ratio \ndescribed in the Leverage Requirements Guideline, and the risk-based capital ratio described in \nthis guideline.\n1 The first test provides an overall measure of the adequacy of an institution's \ncapital. The second measure focuses on risk faced by the institution. Notwithstanding that a \nbank, bank holding company, trust company, or loan company may meet these standards, the \nSuperintendent may direct a bank or bank holding company to increase its capital under \nsubsections 485(3) or 949(3) of the BA, or a trust company or a loan company to increase its \ncapital under subsection 473(3) of the TLCA. \n \nOSFI, as a member of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, participated in the \ndevelopment of the Basel capital framework on which this guideline is based. Where relevant, \nthe Basel framework paragraph numbers are provided in square brackets at the end of each \nparagraph referencing material from the Basel framework.  \n \n1    The capital and leverage requirements for domestic systemically important banks are supplemented by the \nrequirements described in OSFI’s Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) Guideline .",

Under the IRB approaches, exposure at default (EAD) is determined gross of all specific \nallowances. The amount used in the calculation of EAD should normally be based on book \nvalue, except for the following where EAD should be based on amortized cost: \n• loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge; and \n• debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensive Income. \n \n11. Under the standardized approach, on-balance sheet exposures should normally be \nmeasured at book value, except the following where exposures should be measured at amortized \ncost: \n• loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge;  \n• debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensive Income; and \n• own-use property, plant and equipment \n \n12. For own-use property that is accounted for using the revaluation model, reported \nexposures should be based on an adjusted book value that reverses the impact of: \n• the balance of any revaluation surplus included in Other Comprehensive Income; and \n• accumulated net after-tax revaluation losses that are reflected in retained earnings or as a \nresult of subsequent revaluations \n \n13. The approaches listed in paragraph 8 specify how institutions should measure the size of \ntheir exposures (i.e. EAD) and determine their RWA. Certain types of transactions in the \nbanking book and trading book (such as derivatives and securities financial transactions) give \nrise to counterparty credit risk, for which the measurement of the size of the exposure can be \ncomplex. Therefore, the approaches listed in paragraph 8 include, or cross refer to, the following \nmethods available to determine the size of the counterparty exposures (refer to section 7.1 of \nChapter 7 for an overview of the counterparty credit risk requirements including the types of \ntransactions to which the methods below can be applied): \n \n6 This includes assets and liabilities booked outside of Canada as well as assets and liabilities of non -residents \nbooked in Canada.",

Institutions must receive explicit prior approval from OSFI in order to use any of the \nfollowing model-based approaches for regulatory capital purposes: the Foundation and \nAdvanced IRB Approaches to credit risk, the IMM to counterparty credit risk, and the Internal \nModels Approach (IMA) to market risk. The steps involved in the application for approval of \nthese approaches are outlined in OSFI Implementation Notes.  \n \n22. OSFI will consider approval with conditions for those institutions that have made a \nsubstantial effort and are found to satisfy most requirements of the internal model regime. The \ninstitution must also be able to provide out of sample back-testing and parallel reporting \nconsistent with OSFI's capital models implementation note.\n8 Institutions that do not receive \napproval will be required to employ a form of the Standardized Approach. \n \n23. An institution achieving approval with conditions for one of the model-based \napproaches will normally be allowed to use the approach (in some cases only after OSFI \nconfirms closure of certain deficiencies) but may be required to adhere to a higher initial capital \nfloor. Once it achieves full compliance with all rollout and data requirements, and OSFI has \nagreed, the institution may proceed to the capital floor of 72.5% described in section 1.5. In \neither case, OSFI will not rule out the possibility of requiring floors on individual asset classes or \nreviewing approval conditions based on implementation progress.  \n \n24. Once approved, institutions are expected to meet the qualitative and quantitative \nrequirements for the internal model approach as set out in the guideline and the supporting \nimplementation notes on an ongoing basis. \n \n1.4.1. Approval to use the IRB Approaches to Credit Risk \n \n25. For IRB credit risk approval, besides meeting the qualitative and quantitative \nrequirements for an IRB rating system, institutions will need, at a minimum, to satisfy the \nfollowing requirements to obtain approval with conditions (with a possibly higher initial floor): \n• The institution is meeting the IRB use test principles.\n9 The use test prohibits institutions \nfrom using default and loss estimates from their own internal ratings that are developed \nfor the sole purpose of calculating regulatory capital, these systems must be used in other \noperations of the institution. \n• On implementation, the institution will have rolled out the Advanced IRB (AIRB) or \nFoundation IRB (FIRB) approach to approximately 80% of its consolidated credit \nexposures, as of the end of the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year in which the institution \nreceives approval to use the IRB approach, measured in terms of gross exposure and total \ncredit RWA.  \n \n \n8      Implementation Note - Assessment of Regulatory Capital Models for Deposit-Taking Institutions \n9     The Use of Ratings and Estimates of Default and Loss at IRB Institutions – Implementation Note",

Once an institution has received an approval to use the IRB Approach, OSFI will \nmonitor, on a quarterly basis, the institution’s compliance with the 80% IRB threshold for its \nconsolidated credit exposures for which an IRB approach is permitted. In the post-approval \nperiod, compliance will be measured in terms of gross exposure and total credit risk-weighted \nassets as at the applicable quarter.  \n \n \n1. 5. Capital Floor–Internal Model Based Approaches \n \n27. To reduce excessive variability of RWA and to enhance the comparability of risk-based \ncapital ratios, institutions using internal model-based approaches for credit risk, counterparty \ncredit risk, or market risk are subject to a floor requirement that is applied to RWA. The capital \nfloor ensures that institutions’ capital requirements do not fall below a certain percentage of \ncapital requirements derived under standardized approaches. The calculation of the floor is set \nout below for institutions that have implemented the IRB approach for credit risk, IMM for \ncounterparty credit risk, or IMA for market risk. Institutions that have only implemented the \nstandardized approaches for credit risk, counterparty credit risk, and market risk are not subject \nto the capital floor. \n \nInstitutions that have implemented one of the internal model-based approaches for credit risk, \ncounterparty credit risk, or market risk must calculate the difference between: \ni. the capital floor as defined in section 1.5.1, and \nii. an adjusted capital requirement as defined in section 1.5.2. \n[Basel Framework, RBC 20.11] \n \n28. If the capital floor amount is larger than the adjusted capital requirement (i.e. the \ndifference is positive), institutions are required to add the difference to the total RWAs otherwise \ncalculated under this guideline. This adjusted RWA figure must be used as the denominator in \nthe calculation of the risk-based capital ratios. \n \n1.5.1. The Capital Floor \n \n29. The base of the capital floor includes the standardized approaches to credit risk and \noperational risk as described in paragraphs 31 through 35. The specific approach for market risk \nis described in paragraph 33. The capital floor is derived by applying an adjustment factor to the \nnet total of the following amounts: \ni. total risk-weighted assets for the capital floor, less \nii. 12.5 times the amount of any general allowance that may be recognized in Tier 2 capital \nfollowing the standardized approach methodology as outlined in Chapter 2 of this \nguideline.",

Total risk-weighted assets are determined by multiplying the capital requirements for \nmarket risk and operational risk by 12.5 and adding the resulting figures to risk-weighted assets \nfor credit risk. The capital ratios are calculated by dividing regulatory capital by total risk-\nweighted assets.

When buffers have been drawn down, there is a range of actions that can be taken to \nrebuild buffers including reducing discretionary distributions of earnings. This could include \nreducing dividends or other discretionary payments on shares or other capital instruments, share \nbuy-backs and, to the extent they are discretionary, staff bonus payments.\n12 Institutions may also \nchoose to raise new capital from the private sector as an alternative to conserving internally \ngenerated capital. Should buffers be drawn down, institutions should implement a capital \nrestoration plan for rebuilding buffers within a reasonable timeframe or, where the breach is \nexpected to be corrected promptly, a plan that provides assurance that the capital conservation \nbuffer will be restored on a sustained basis. The capital restoration plan should be discussed with \nOSFI as part of the capital planning process. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.21] \n \n45. Greater efforts should be made to rebuild buffers the more they have been depleted.

The distribution constraints \nincrease as institutions’ capital levels approach the minimum requirements. By design, the \nconstraints imposed on institutions with capital levels at the top of the range would be minimal. \nThis reflects an expectation that institutions’ capital levels may fall into this range from time to \ntime. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.2 and 30.3] \n \n49. Table 5 sets out the minimum capital conservation ratios an institution must meet at \nvarious levels of CET1 capital.\n14 The applicable conservation ratio must be recalculated at each \ndistribution date. Once imposed, conservation ratios will remain in place until such time as capital \nratios have been restored. If an institution wants to make payments in excess of the constraints set \nout in Table 5, sufficient capital must be raised in the private sector to fully compensate for the \nexcess distribution. This alternative should be discussed with OSFI as part of an institution’s \nInternal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). For the purposes of determining the \nminimum capital conservation ratio, the CET1 ratio includes amounts used to meet the 4.5% \nminimum CET1 requirement, but excludes any additional CET1 needed to meet the 6% Tier 1 and \n8% Total Capital requirements, as well as any CET1 capital needed to meet D-SIBs’ Total Loss \nAbsorbing Capacity (TLAC) requirements where applicable. For example, an institution with 8% \nCET1 and no Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital would meet all minimum capital requirements, but \nwould have a 0% capital conservation buffer and therefore be subject to the 100% constraint on \ncapital distributions. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4] \n \nTable 5: Minimum capital conservation ratios for corresponding levels of CET1 \nCET1 Ratio Minimum Capital Conservation Ratios (expressed as percentage \nof earnings) \n4.5% - 5.125% 100% \n>5.125% - 5.75% 80% \n>5.75% - 6.375% 60% \n>6.375% - 7.0% 40% \n>7.0% 0% \n \n50. If an institution’s capital ratio falls below the levels set out in Table 4, capital \nconservation ratios will be imposed that automatically limit distributions. As outlined in Table 5, \nthese limits increase as an institution’s capital levels approach the minimum requirements. For \nexample, an institution with a CET1 capital ratio in the range of 5.125% to 5.75% would be \nrequired to maintain the equivalent of 80% of its earnings in the subsequent payment period (i.e. \npay out no more than 20% in capital distributions). For clarity, where an institution’s disclosed \nratio is within the ranges where restrictions apply, distributions for the following payment period \nwill be constrained based on the most recently reported ratio irrespective of the current capital \nposition of the institution. Restrictions will remain in place until the capital conservation buffer \nis restored. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4] \n \n \n14  Similar capital conservation ratios apply where an institution breaches its Tier 1 capital or Total capital \nrequirements.

The countercyclical buffer aims to ensure that banking sector capital requirements take \naccount of the macro-financial environment in which institutions operate.

[Basel Framework, RBC 30.7] \n \n54. The countercyclical buffer regime consists, in Canada, of the following elements: \n(a) OSFI, in consultation with its Senior Advisory Committee\n15 (SAC) partners, will monitor \ncredit growth and other indicators16 that may signal a build-up of system-wide risks17 and \nmake an assessment of whether credit growth is excessive and is leading to the build-up \nof system-wide risks. Based on this assessment, a countercyclical buffer requirement, \nranging from 0% to 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets,\n18 will be put in place when \n \n15  SAC is a non-statutory body chaired by the Deputy Minister of Finance. Its membership is the same as the \nFinancial Institutions Supervisory Committee (“FISC”), i.e. OSFI, the Department of Finance, the Bank of \nCanada, the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada. The SAC \noperates as a consultative body and provides a forum for policy discussion on issues pertaining to the financial \nsector.  \n16  The document entitled Guidance for national authorities operating the countercyclical capital buffer , sets out the \nprinciples that national authorities have agreed to follow in making buffer decisions.

To give \ninstitutions time to adjust to a buffer level, OSFI will pre-announce its decision, to activate or \nraise the level of the countercyclical buffer, by up to 12 months but no less than 6 months. \nConversely, decisions to release the countercyclical buffer will normally take effect immediately. \nInstitutions with foreign exposures are expected to match host jurisdictions’ implementation \ntimelines unless the announcement period is shorter than 6 months in which case compliance will \nonly be required 6 months after the host’s announcement.\n27 [Basel Framework, RBC 30.11] \n \n64. The maximum countercyclical buffer relating to foreign private sector credit exposures \nwill be 2.5% of total RWAs.28 Jurisdictions may choose to implement a buffer in excess of 2.5%, \nif deemed appropriate in their national context; in such cases the international reciprocity \nprovisions will not apply to the additional amounts. In addition, institutions are not expected to \nreplicate sectoral buffers or similar measures adopted by foreign jurisdictions that depart from \nthe internationally agreed countercyclical buffer. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.9] Institutions must \nensure that their countercyclical buffer is calculated and publicly disclosed with at least the same \nfrequency as their minimum capital requirements. In addition, when disclosing their buffers, if \nany, institutions must also disclose the geographic breakdown of their private sector credit \nexposures used in the calculation of the buffer. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.19] \n \n1. 8. Domestic Systemically Important Bank (D-SIB) Surcharge \n \n65. OSFI has designated six Canadian institutions as D-SIBs: Bank of Montreal, Bank of \nNova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, National Bank of Canada, Royal Bank of \nCanada, and Toronto-Dominion Bank.\n29 D-SIBs will be subject to a CET1 surcharge equal to 1% \nof RWAs. The 1% capital surcharge will be periodically reviewed in light of national and \ninternational developments. This is consistent with the levels and timing set out in the BCBS D-\nSIB framework. [BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.7 to 40.23] \n \n66. The 1% surcharge will be implemented through an extension of the capital conservation \nbuffer. This is in line with the treatment of the higher loss absorbency requirement for global \nsystemically important banks (G-SIBs) prescribed by the BCBS.\n30 Table 7 below sets out the \nminimum capital conservation ratios a D-SIB must meet at various CET1 capital ratios and Tier \n1 leverage ratios.31 D-SIBs will thus be subject to a pre-determined set of restrictions on the \n \n25  The Superintendent will consider factors such as whether an institution’s business model involves providing \ncredit through intermediation of funds or whether the conditions that give rise to financial system-wide issues are \nexplicitly addressed in a robust manner in the institution’s internal capital targets.  \n26   The countercyclical buffer is to be computed and applied at the consolidated FRFI parent level, i. e. OSFI \nregulated deposit-taking institutions who are subsidiaries of an OSFI regulated deposit-taking institution are not \nsubject to the countercyclical buffer. \n27   The pre-announced buffer decision and actual buffer in place will be published on the BIS website.  \n28   For Category III SMSBs, the countercyclical buffer would be applied as a % of [Adjusted Total Assets + RWA \nOperational Risk]. \n29  Annex 1 contains additional details around OSFI’s process for designating Canadian institutions as D -SIBs. \n30   BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.1 to 40.6 \n31  Similar capital conservation ratios apply where a D-SIB breaches its Tier 1 capital or Total capital requirements. \nIn the event that a D-SIB simultaneously breaches more than one capital requirement (e.g. 8% CET1, 9.5% Tier \n1, 11.5% Total Capital) it must apply the most constraining capital conservation ratio.",

Domestic Stability Buffer \n \n67. In addition to the buffers described in sections 1.7.1, 1.7.2, and 1.8, D-SIBs are subject to \na Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB).\n32 The DSB is intended to cover a range of systemic \nvulnerabilities that, in OSFI’s supervisory judgement, are not adequately captured in the Pillar 1 \ncapital requirements described in this guideline. In addition to the DSB, D-SIBs may be required \nto hold further Pillar II capital, as warranted, to address idiosyncratic or systemic risks that are \nnot adequately captured by the Pillar I requirements and buffers. Decisions on the calibration of \nthe DSB are based on supervisory judgement, informed by analytical work on a range of \nvulnerabilities, and are made in consultation with the Financial Institutions Supervisory \nCommittee (FISC).\n33 \n \n68. The level of the DSB will range between 0 and 4.0% of a D-SIB’s total RWA calculated \nunder this guideline. The level of the DSB will be the same for all D-SIBs and must be met with \nCET1 capital.  \n \n69. Unlike the other buffers described in this guideline, the DSB is not a Pillar 1 buffer and \nbreaches will not result in D-SIBs being subject to the automatic constraints on capital \ndistributions described in section 1.7. If a D-SIB breaches the buffer (i.e. dips into the buffer \nwhen it has not been released), OSFI will require a remediation plan. Supervisory interventions \npursuant to OSFI’s Guide to Intervention\n34 would occur in cases where a remediation plan is not \nproduced or executed in a timely manner satisfactory to OSFI.  \n \n \n32   Details related to the OSFI’s DSB are included on OSFI’s website: Domestic Stability Buffer \n33   Established under section 18 of the OSFI Act, the Financial Institutions Supervisory Committee consists of the \nSuperintendent of Financial Institutions, the Commissioner of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, the \nGovernor of the Bank of Canada, the Chief Executive Officer of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, and \nthe Deputy Minister of Finance. \n34  Guide to Intervention for Federally Regulated Deposit-Taking Institutions",

D-SIBs should take into account the DSB in their internal capital planning process. \nAdditionally, D-SIBs should report the DSB in their quarterly public disclosures, and include a \nbrief narrative on any changes to the buffer level. Breaches of the buffer by an individual D-SIB \nwill require public disclosure pursuant to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). \n \n71. The specific vulnerabilities covered by the DSB are expected to evolve over time, as they \nare based on current market conditions in combination with forward-looking expectations around \nthe materialization of risks to key vulnerabilities, and will be communicated as part of the semi-\nannual DSB level-setting announcements. The decision to include a vulnerability will be based \non whether it is measurable, material, cyclical and has a system-wide impact that could \nmaterialize in the foreseeable future.  \n \n72. OSFI will undertake a review of the buffer on a semi-annual basis, and any changes to \nthe buffer will be made public, in June and December, along with supporting rationale. In \nexceptional circumstances, OSFI may make and announce adjustments to the buffer in-between \nscheduled review dates. Transparency in setting the DSB will support institutions’ ability to use \nthis capital in times of stress by improving the understanding of the purpose of the buffer and \nhow it should be used.  \n \n73. Decreases of the buffer may occur in a situation when OSFI identifies that D-SIBs’ \nexposures to the vulnerabilities have diminished or that risks have materialized. In the latter case, \na decrease would be intended to allow D-SIBs to continue to provide loans and services to credit \nworthy households and businesses and/or to incur losses without breaching their capital targets. \nIncreases to the buffer may occur when OSFI is of the view that it would be prudent for D-SIBs \nto hold additional capital to protect against the identified vulnerabilities. Increases will be subject \nto a phase-in period; decreases will be effective immediately. \n \n1. 10. Capital Targets \n \n74. In addition to the minimum capital requirements described in section 1.6, OSFI expects \nall institutions to maintain target capital ratios equal to or greater than the minimum capital ratios \nplus the conservation buffer.\n35 For SMSBs, this means target ratios of at least 7% for CET1, \n8.5% for Tier 1 and 10.5% for Total capital. D-SIBs are expected to maintain target capital ratios \nequal to or greater than the minimum capital ratios plus the sum of the conservation buffer, the \nD-SIB surcharge and the DSB. For D-SIBs, this equates to target ratios of least 8% for CET1, \n9.5% for Tier 1, and 11.5% for Total capital plus the DSB.36 The target capital ratios for SMSBs \nand D-SIBs are summarized below in Table 8 below and illustrated in Annex 2.  \n \n \n \n \n \n35   The conservation buffer is the sum of the 2.5% capital conservation buffer plus any countercyclical buffer add-\nons, where applicable. \n36   As an example, where the DSB is set to 2% of RWA, D-SIBs’ target capital ratios would be at least 10% for \nCET1, 11.5% for Tier 1 and 13.5% for Total capital. This reflects a conservation buffer of 2.5% and a D -SIB \nsurcharge of 1.0%.",

The framework39 for dealing with D-SIBs set out by the BCBS indicates that domestic \nsystemic importance should be assessed with reference to the impact that an institution’s failure \ncould have on the domestic economy. Further, it notes that this assessment should consider \ninstitution-specific characteristics of systemic importance, such as size, inter-connectedness and \nsubstitutability, which are correlated with the systemic impact of failure. Accordingly, OSFI’s \nassessment of domestic systemic importance for Canadian institutions considers a range of \nindicators such as asset size, intra-financial claims and liabilities, and an institution’s roles in \ndomestic financial markets and in financial infrastructures. This section describes OSFI’s \ninferences from various measures of systemic importance.  \n \nSize  \n \n2. In general, an institution’s distress or failure is more likely to damage the Canadian \nfinancial system or economy if its activities comprise a large share of domestic banking activity. \nWhen Canadian institutions are compared according to their size as measured by total \nconsolidated assets, and by place of booking of assets, that is, according to whether the assets are \nbooked in Canada or abroad, the data show that: \n• the largest six banks account for more than 90% total banking assets; \n• the differences among the largest banks are smaller if only domestic assets are \nconsidered; and \n• relative systemic importance declines rapidly after the top five banks and after the \nsixth bank.  \n \nInter-connections \n \n3. The more inter-connected an institution is to other financial institutions, the greater is the \npotential for the failure of that institution to transmit problems throughout the financial system \nand to the broader economy. As a result, measurements of inter-connectedness also inform \ninstitutions’ systemic importance. Comparing Canadian institutions according to measures of \nintra-financial assets (i.e. claims on other financial institutions) and intra-financial liabilities (i.e. \nobligations to other financial institutions) again points to the dominance of the largest Canadian \nbanks. The rank-ordering among these banks, however, depends on the specific inter-\nconnectedness measure under consideration.   \n \nSubstitutability \n \n4. The systemic impact of an institution’s distress or failure is greater the less easily it can \nbe replaced as both a market participant and a financial service provider. As a result, OSFI’s \nidentification of D-SIBs also takes into account the types of roles that institutions play in \ndomestic financial markets and in domestic financial infrastructures, which inform views \nregarding substitutability. For example, this includes underwriter rankings in Canadian financial \n \n39  A framework for dealing with domestic systemically important banks (BCBS: October 2012)",

The largest \nbanks are also the dominant participants in CDSX, the clearing and settlement system for \nsecurities transactions in Canada. Some large Canadian banks also play key roles as members of \nthe CLS Bank, the global institution that settles foreign exchange transactions between banks in \nCanadian dollars and other major currencies.41 For example, the Royal Bank of Canada and the \nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce are the key Canadian-dollar liquidity providers for \nsettling Canadian dollar foreign exchange transactions through the CLS network. \n \n5. A variety of additional information has been assessed and recurring themes across the \nrange of evidence are the following:  \n• The five largest banks are by far the dominant banks in Canada, and consistently play \ncentral roles in a range of activities in the Canadian financial system; and   \n• The rank-order importance of the largest banks, as well as the relative differences \nbetween them, varies somewhat according to the measure considered.   \n \n6. This suggests that there are strong grounds for treating these banks in the same way, \nrather than relying on arbitrary weights to develop a single index of systemic importance. \nFurther, distinguishing reliably between the adverse effects on the Canadian economy from \nindividual D-SIB failures is largely moot, given the difficulty of credibly differentiating between \nthe large adverse impacts on the Canadian economy from the failure of any one of the largest \nbanks. This also argues against making distinctions between identified Canadian D-SIBs to \nassign degrees of systemic importance.\n  \n \n7. Given these various considerations, the Canadian D-SIBs are judged to be Bank of \nMontreal, The Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank of \nCanada, and The Toronto-Dominion Bank, without further distinction between them. National \nBank of Canada has also been designated as a D-SIB given its importance relative to other less \nprominent banks and in the interest of prudence given the inherent challenges in identifying \nahead of time which banks are likely to be systemic in times of stress. The designation of D-SIB \nstatus will be periodically reviewed and updated as needed.  \n \nHigher Loss Absorbency Targets \n \n8. The goal of a higher loss absorbency target is to reduce further the probability of failure \nof a D-SIB relative to non-systemic institutions, reflecting the greater impact that a D-SIB failure \nmay have on the domestic financial system and the economy. This surcharge takes into account \nthe structure of the Canadian financial system, the importance of large banks to the financial \narchitecture, and the expanded regulatory toolkit required to resolve a troubled financial \n \n40   ACSS handles all Canadian dollar payments not processed by the LVTS. \n41  CLS Bank provides a real-time global network that links a number of national payments systems to settle the \nforeign exchange transactions of its member banks",

The BCBS D-SIB framework provides for national discretion to accommodate \ncharacteristics of the domestic financial system and other local features, including the domestic \npolicy framework. The additional capital surcharge for banks designated as systemically \nimportant provides credible additional loss absorbency given: \n• extreme loss events as a percentage of RWA among this peer group over the past 25 \nyears would be less than the combination of the CET1 (2.5%) capital conservation \nbuffer and an additional 1%; and \n• current business models of the six largest banks are generally less exposed to the fat \ntailed risks associated with investment banking than some international peers, and the \nsix largest banks have a greater reliance on retail funding models compared to \nwholesale funding than some international peers – features that proved beneficial in \nlight of the experience of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. \nFrom a forward-looking perspective: \n• Canadian D-SIBs that hold capital at current targets plus a 1% surcharge (i.e. 8%) \nshould be able to weather a wide range of severe but plausible shocks without \nbecoming non-viable; and  \n• the higher loss absorbency in a crisis scenario achieved by the conversion to common \nequity) of the 2% to 3% in Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 NVCC capital instruments \npromoted by Basel III also adds to the resiliency of banks.  \n \nRelationship with Basel Committee G-SIB Framework \n \n9. OSFI has adopted the Basel Committee’s framework on the assessment methodology for \nG-SIBs. The assessment methodology for G-SIBs follows an indicator-based approach agreed by \nthe BCBS that will determine which institutions are to be designated as G-SIBs and subject to \nadditional loss absorbency requirements that range from 1% to 3.5% RWA, depending on an \ninstitution's global systemic importance.\n42 For Canadian D-SIBs that are also designated as G-\nSIBs, the higher of the D-SIB and G-SIB surcharges will apply.43  \n \nSupervisory Implications \n \n10. Canadian D-SIBs are expected to have advanced practices in terms of the design and \noperation of oversight functions and internal controls. OSFI expects these practices to continue \nto improve as supervision becomes more intensive and international best practices evolve. The \ninstitutions designated as D-SIBs have historically had, and will continue to be subject to, more \nintensive supervision because of their larger size, broader and more complex business models \nand consequently more significant risk profiles. The principles of risk based supervisory \nintensity are reflected in OSFI’s Supervisory Framework.\n44 The Framework is applied on a \nconsolidated basis to all Canadian institutions and requires OSFI supervisors to determine the \n \n42   BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.1 to 40.6 and SCO 40.1 to 50.20  \n43   Details related to G-SIB’s annual public disclosure requirements are included in OSFI’s Global Systemically \nImportant Banks – Public Disclosure Requirements Advisory    \n44  OSFI’s Supervisory Framework (OSFI: February 2011)",

For reference, the \nBasel paragraph numbers that are associated with the text appearing in this chapter are \nindicated in square brackets at the end of each paragraph.\n2 \n \n7.1. Treatment of counterparty credit risk and cross-product netting \n \n2. This rule identifies permissible methods for estimating the Exposure at Default (EAD) \nor the exposure amount for instruments with counterparty credit risk under this guideline.\n3  \nInstitutions may seek OSFI approval to make use of an Internal Modelling Method (IMM) \nmeeting the requirements and specifications identified herein. As an alternative institutions may \nalso use the Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR). [Basel Framework, \nCRE 53.1] \n7.1.1 Definitions and general terminology \n3. This section defines terms that will be used throughout this chapter. \n \n7.1.1.1 General terms \n \n• Counterparty Credit Risk (CCR) is the risk that the counterparty to a transaction could \ndefault before the final settlement of the transaction's cash flows. An economic loss \nwould occur if the transactions or portfolio of transactions with the counterparty has a \npositive economic value at the time of default. Unlike an institution’s exposure to credit \nrisk through a loan, where the exposure to credit risk is unilateral and only the lending \ninstitution faces the risk of loss, CCR creates a bilateral risk of loss: the market value of \nthe transaction can be positive or negative to either counterparty to the transaction. The \nmarket value is uncertain and can vary over time with the movement of underlying \nmarket factors. \n• A central counterparty (CCP) is a clearing house that interposes itself between \ncounterparties to contracts traded in one or more financial markets, becoming the buyer \nto every seller and the seller to every buyer and thereby ensuring the future performance \nof open contracts. A CCP becomes a counterparty to trades with market participants \nthrough novation, an open offer system, or another legally binding arrangement. For the \npurposes of the capital framework, a CCP is a financial institution.   \n• A qualifying central counterparty (QCCP) is an entity that is licensed to operate as a \nCCP (including a license granted by way of confirming an exemption), and is permitted \nby the appropriate regulator/overseer to operate as such with respect to the products \n \n1    The Basel Framework  \n2  Following the format: [Basel Framework XXX yy.zz]. \n3 In this document, the terms “exposure at default” and “exposure amount” are used together in order to identify \nmeasures of exposure under both an internal ratings-based (IRB) and a standardized approach for credit risk.",

This is subject to the provision that the CCP is based and prudentially supervised \nin a jurisdiction where the relevant regulator/overseer has established, and publicly \nindicated that it applies to the CCP on an ongoing basis, domestic rules and regulations \nthat are consistent with the CPSS-IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures. \nWhere the CCP is in a jurisdiction that does not have a CCP regulator applying the \nPrinciples to the CCP, then OSFI may make the determination of whether the CCP meets \nthis definition.  \nIn addition, for a CCP to be considered as a QCCP, the requirements in paragraph 204 \nmust be met to permit each clearing member institution to calculate its capital \nrequirement for its default fund contributions.  \n• A clearing member is a member of, or a direct participant in, a CCP that is entitled to \nenter into a transaction with the CCP, regardless of whether it enters into trades with a \nCCP for its own hedging, investment or speculative purposes or whether it also enters \ninto trades as a financial intermediary between the CCP and other market participants.\n4  \n• A client is a party to a transaction with a CCP through either a clearing member acting as \na financial intermediary, or a clearing member guaranteeing the performance of the client \nto the CCP.  \n• Initial margin means a clearing member’s or client’s funded collateral posted to the CCP \nto mitigate the potential future exposure of the CCP to the clearing member arising from \nthe possible future change in the value of their transactions. For the purposes of the \ncalculation of counterparty credit risk capital requirements, initial margin does not \ninclude contributions to a CCP for mutualized loss sharing arrangements (i.e., in case a \nCCP uses initial margin to mutualize losses among the clearing members, it will be \ntreated as a default fund exposure). Initial margin may include excess collateral, in cases \nwhere the CCP may prevent the clearing member and the clearing member may prevent \nthe client from withdrawing the excess.   \n• Variation margin means a clearing member’s or client’s funded collateral posted on a \ndaily or intraday basis to a CCP based upon price movements of their transactions.  \n• Trade exposures (in section 7.1.8) include the current\n5 and potential future exposure of a \nclearing member or a client to a CCP arising from OTC derivatives, exchange traded \nderivatives transactions or securities financing transactions (SFTs), as well as initial \nmargin.  \n• Default funds, also known as clearing deposits or guaranty fund contributions (or any \nother names), are clearing members’ funded or unfunded contributions towards, or \nunderwriting of, a CCP’s mutualized loss sharing arrangements. The description given by \n \n4  For the purposes of this chapter, where a CCP has a link to a second CCP, that second CCP is to be treated as a \nclearing member of the first CCP. Whether the second CCP’s collateral contribution t o the first CCP is treated as \ninitial margin or a default fund contribution will depend upon the legal arrangement between the CCPs. OSFI \nshould be consulted to determine the treatment of this initial margin and default fund contributions.    \n5  For the purposes of this definition, the current exposure of a clearing member includes the variation margin due \nto the clearing member but not yet received.",

For exposures between clients and clients of clients, we use the \nterm “higher-level client” for the institution providing clearing services; and the term \n“lower level client” for the institution clearing through that client.  \n[Basel Framework, CRE 50.6] \n \n7.1.1.2 Transaction types \n \n• Long Settlement Transactions are transactions where a counterparty undertakes to \ndeliver a security, a commodity, or a foreign exchange amount against cash, other \nfinancial instruments, or commodities, or vice versa, at a settlement or delivery date that \nis contractually specified as more than the lower of the market standard for this particular \ninstrument and five business days after the date on which the institution enters into the \ntransaction.  \n• Securities Financing Transactions (SFTs) are transactions such as repurchase \nagreements, reverse repurchase agreements, security lending and borrowing, and margin \nlending transactions, where the value of the transactions depends on market valuations \nand the transactions are often subject to margin agreements.  \n• Margin Lending Transactions are transactions in which an institution extends credit in \nconnection with the purchase, sale, carrying or trading of securities. Margin lending \ntransactions do not include other loans that happen to be secured by securities collateral. \nGenerally, in margin lending transactions, the loan amount is collateralized by securities \nwhose value is greater than the amount of the loan. \n[Basel Framework, CRE 50.14] \n \n7.1.1.3 Netting sets, hedging sets, and related terms \n \n• Netting Set is a group of transactions with a single counterparty that are subject to a \nlegally enforceable bilateral netting arrangement and for which netting is recognized for \nregulatory capital purposes under Chapter 4 or the Cross-Product Netting Rules set forth \nin this chapter. Each transaction that is not subject to a legally enforceable bilateral \nnetting arrangement that is recognized for regulatory capital purposes should be \ninterpreted as its own netting set for the purpose of these rules. \n• Hedging Set is a set of transactions within a single netting set within which full or partial \noffsetting is recognized for purposes of calculating the potential future exposure (PFE) \nadd-on of the SA-CCR. .",

This \neffective maturity may be adjusted to reflect rollover risk by replacing expected exposure \nwith effective expected exposure for forecasting horizons under one year. The formula is \ngiven in paragraph 35.  \n• Cross-Product Netting refers to the inclusion of transactions of different product \ncategories within the same netting set pursuant to the Cross-Product Netting Rules set out \nin this chapter.  \n• Current Market Value (CMV) refers to the net market value of the portfolio of \ntransactions within the netting set with the counterparty.

Current exposure is often also called Replacement Cost.  \n• Peak Exposure is a high percentile (typically 95% or 99%) of the distribution of \nexposures at any particular future date before the maturity date of the longest transaction \nin the netting set. A peak exposure value is typically generated for many future dates up \nuntil the longest maturity date of transactions in the netting set. \n• Expected Exposure is the mean (average) of the distribution of exposures at any \nparticular future date before the longest-maturity transaction in the netting set matures. \nAn expected exposure value is typically generated for many future dates up until the \nlongest maturity date of transactions in the netting set. \n• Effective Expected Exposure at a specific date is the maximum expected exposure that \noccurs at that date or any prior date. Alternatively, it may be defined for a specific date as \nthe greater of the expected exposure at that date, or the effective exposure at the previous \ndate. In effect, the Effective Expected Exposure is the Expected Exposure that is \nconstrained to be non-decreasing over time. \n• Expected Positive Exposure (EPE) is the weighted average over time of expected \nexposures where the weights are the proportion that an individual expected exposure \nrepresents of the entire time interval. When calculating the minimum capital requirement, \nthe average is taken over the first year or, if all the contracts in the netting set mature \nbefore one year, over the time period of the longest-maturity contract in the netting set.  \n• Effective Expected Positive Exposure (Effective EPE) is the weighted average over \ntime of effective expected exposure over the first year, or, if all the contracts in the \nnetting set mature before one year, over the time period of the longest-maturity contract \nin the netting set where the weights are the proportion that an individual expected \nexposure represents of the entire time interval.  \n• Credit Valuation Adjustment is an adjustment to the mid-market valuation of the \nportfolio of trades with a counterparty. This adjustment reflects the market value of the \ncredit risk due to any failure to perform on contractual agreements with a counterparty. \nThis adjustment may reflect the market value of the credit risk of the counterparty or the \nmarket value of the credit risk of both the institution and the counterparty.  \n• One-Sided Credit Valuation Adjustment is a credit valuation adjustment that reflects \nthe market value of the credit risk of the counterparty to the firm, but does not reflect the \nmarket value of the credit risk of the institution to the counterparty. \n• Debit Valuation Adjustment is a valuation adjustment that reflects the market value of \nthe credit risk of the institution to the counterparty (i.e. changes in the reporting \ninstitution’s own credit risk), but does not reflect the market value of the credit risk of the \ncounterparty to the institution.

Other common characteristics of the transactions to be covered may include the \nfollowing: \n• collateral may be used to mitigate risk exposure and is inherent in the nature of some \ntransactions; \n• short-term financing may be a primary objective in that the transactions mostly consist of \nan exchange of one asset for another (cash or securities) for a relatively short period of \ntime, usually for the business purpose of financing. The two sides of the transactions are \nnot the result of separate decisions but form an indivisible whole to accomplish a defined \nobjective; \n• netting may be used to mitigate the risk; \n• positions are frequently valued (most commonly on a daily basis), according to market \nvariables. \n• remargining may be employed. \n[Basel Framework, CRE 51.6] \n \n7.1.3 Methods for Computing CCR Exposure \n7. For the transaction types listed in paragraph 4 above, banks must calculate their \ncounterparty credit risk exposure, or exposure at default (EAD),\n7 using one of the methods set \nout in paragraphs 8 to 9 below. The methods vary according to the type of the transaction, the \ncounterparty to the transaction, and whether the bank has received supervisory approval to use \nthe method (if such approval is required). [Basel Framework, CRE 51.7] \n8. For exposures that are not cleared through a central counterparty (CCP) the following \nmethods must be used to calculate the counterparty credit risk exposure:  \n(1) The standardized approach for measuring counterparty credit risk exposures (SA-CCR), \nwhich is set out in section 7.1.7. This method is to be used for exposures arising from OTC \nderivatives, exchange-traded derivatives and long settlement transactions. This method must be \nused if the bank does not have approval to use the internal model method (IMM).  \n(2) The simple approach or comprehensive approach to the recognition of collateral, which are \nboth set out in the credit risk mitigation section of the standardized approach to credit risk (see \nChapter 4, section 4.3). These methods are to be used for securities financing transactions (SFTs) \nand must be used if the bank does not have approval to use the value-at-risk (VaR) models or the \nIMM.  \n \n7    The terms “exposure” and “EAD” are used interchangably in the counterparty credit risk chapters of the credit \nrisk standard. This reflects the fact that the amounts calculated under the counterparty credit risk rules must \ntypically be used as either the “exposure” within the standardized approach to credit risk, or the EAD within the \ninternal ratings-based (IRB) approach to credit risk, as described in paragraph 13.",

CCR exposure or EAD is measured at the level of the netting set as defined in sections \n7.1.1 and 7.1.6. A qualifying internal model for measuring counterparty credit exposure must \nspecify the forecasting distribution for changes in the market value of the netting set attributable \nto changes in market variables, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, etc. The model then \ncomputes the firm’s CCR exposure for the netting set at each future date given the changes in the \nmarket variables. For margined counterparties, the model may also capture future collateral \nmovements. Institutions may include eligible financial collateral as defined in section 4.3.3 and \nChapter 9 in their forecasting distributions for changes in the market value of the netting set, if \nthe quantitative, qualitative and data requirements for internal model method are met for the \ncollateral. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.6] \n \n21. To determine the default risk capital charge for counterparty credit risk for exposures \nsubject to the IMM, institutions must use the greater of the portfolio-level capital charge (not \nincluding the CVA charge in Chapter 8) based on Effective EPE using current market data and \nthe portfolio-level capital charge based on Effective EPE using a stress calibration. The stress \ncalibration should be a single consistent stress calibration for the whole portfolio of \ncounterparties. The greater of Effective EPE using current market data and the stress calibration \nshould be applied on a total portfolio level and not on a counterparty by counterparty basis. \n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.7] \n \n22. OSFI expects institutions to have in place a policy for verifying the adequacy of, and \nupdating, their choice of stress period. This policy would have to be approved in advance by \nOSFI as part of the IMM model approval process. Changes to this policy would constitute a \nmajor modification of the IMM model. \n \n23. To the extent that an institution recognizes collateral in exposure amount or EAD via \ncurrent exposure, an institution would not be permitted to recognize the benefits in its estimates \nof LGD. As a result, the institution would be required to use an LGD of an otherwise similar \nuncollateralized facility. In other words, it would be required to use an LGD that does not \ninclude collateral that is already included in EAD. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.8] \n \n24.

[Basel \nFramework, CRE 53.10] \n \n26. When using an internal model, exposure amount or EAD is calculated as the product of \nalpha times Effective EPE, as specified below (except for counterparties that have been \nidentified as having explicit specific wrong-way risk or specific right-way risk – see paragraph \n65): \n \nEAD = α × Effective EPE  (1) \n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.11] \n27. Effective EPE (“Expected Positive Exposure”) is computed by estimating expected \nexposure (EE\nt) as the average exposure at future date t, where the average is taken across \npossible future values of relevant market risk factors, such as interest rates, foreign exchange \nrates, etc.  The internal model estimates EE as a series of future dates t1, t2, t3…10. Specifically, \n“Effective EE” is computed recursively, where the current date is denoted as t0 and Effective \nEEt0 equals current exposure: \nEffective EEtk = max(Effective EEtk-1, EEtk)  (2) \nwhere the current date is denoted as t0 and Effective EEt0 equals current exposure.   \n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.12] \n28. In this regard, “Effective EPE” is the average Effective EE during the first year of future \nexposure.

Eligible institutions must \nmeet all the operating requirements for internal estimates of EPE and must demonstrate that their \ninternal estimates of alpha capture in the numerator the material sources of stochastic \ndependency of distributions of market values of transactions or of portfolios of transactions \nacross counterparties (e.g. the correlation of defaults across counterparties and between market \nrisk and default).

If the netting set is subject to a margin agreement and the internal model captures the \neffects of margining when estimating EE, the model’s EE measure may be used directly in \nequation (2).

As such, they are subject to a higher degree of supervisory scrutiny before they \nare approved, as discussed below.  [Basel Framework, CRE 53.22] \n \n39. An EPE model must also include transaction-specific information in order to capture the \neffects of margining. It must take into account both the current amount of margin and margin \nthat would be passed between counterparties in the future. Such a model must account for the \nnature of margin agreements (unilateral or bilateral), the frequency of margin calls, the margin \nperiod of risk, the thresholds of unmargined exposure the institution is willing to accept, and the \nminimum transfer amount.

Where appropriate, the \ninstitution must measure current exposure gross and net of collateral held.

An institution must have procedures in place to \nidentify, monitor and control cases of SWWR, beginning at the inception of a trade and \ncontinuing through the life of the trade. To calculate the CCR capital charge, the instruments for \nwhich there exists a legal connection between the counterparty and the underlying issuer, and for \nwhich specific wrong way risk has been identified, are not considered to be in the same netting \nset as other transactions with the counterparty. Furthermore, for single-name credit default swaps \nwhere there exists a legal connection between the counterparty and the underlying issuer, and \nwhere SWWR has been identified, EAD in respect of such swap counterparty exposure equals \nthe full expected loss in the remaining fair value of the underlying instruments assuming the \nunderlying issuer is in liquidation. The use of the full expected loss in remaining fair value of the \nunderlying instrument allows the institution to recognize, in respect of such swap, the market \nvalue that has been lost already and any expected recoveries.

Where a margin agreement exists, the \nformulation could apply both to bilateral transactions and central clearing relationships. The \nformulation also addresses the various arrangements that an institution may have to post and/or \nreceive collateral that may be referred to as initial margin. [Basel Framework, CRE 52.9] \n \nA. Formulation for unmargined transactions \n \n105. For unmargined transactions (that is, where VM is not exchanged, but collateral other \nthan VM may be present), RC is defined as the greater of: (i) the current market value of the \nderivative contracts less net haircut collateral held by the institution (if any), and (ii) zero. This is \nconsistent with the use of replacement cost as the measure of current exposure, meaning that \nwhen the institution owes the counterparty money it has no exposure to the counterparty if it can \ninstantly replace its trades and sell collateral at current market prices. Mathematically:   \n \nRC = max{V-C,0} \nwhere V is the value of the derivative transactions in the netting set and C is the haircut value of \nnet collateral held, which is calculated in accordance with the NICA methodology defined in \nparagraph 112. For this purpose, the value of non-cash collateral posted by the institution to its \ncounterparty is increased and the value of the non-cash collateral received by the institution from \nits counterparty is decreased using haircuts (which are the same as those that apply to repo-style \ntransactions) for the time periods described in paragraph 100.  \n[Basel Framework, CRE 52.10 and 52.11] \n \n106. In the above formulation, it is assumed that the replacement cost representing today’s \nexposure to the counterparty cannot go less than zero. However, institutions sometimes hold \nexcess collateral (even in the absence of a margin agreement) or have out-of-the-money trades \nwhich can further protect the institution from the increase of the exposure.

It also employs concepts used in standard margining agreements, as discussed more \nfully below. [Basel Framework, CRE 52.13] \n \n109. The RC for margined transactions in the SA-CCR is defined as the greatest exposure \nthat would not trigger a call for VM, taking into account the mechanics of collateral exchanges in \nmargining agreements. Such mechanics include, for example, “Threshold”, “Minimum Transfer \nAmount” and “Independent Amount” in the standard industry documentation,\n23 which are \nfactored into a call for VM.24 [Basel Framework, CRE 52.14] \n \nC. Incorporating NICA into replacement cost \n \n110. One objective of the SA-CCR is to more fully reflect the effect of margining agreements \nand the associated exchange of collateral in the calculation of CCR exposures.

To avoid confusion surrounding the use of terms initial margin and independent amount \nwhich are used in various contexts and sometimes interchangeably, the term independent \ncollateral amount (ICA) is introduced.

That is, NICA represents any collateral (segregated or unsegregated) posted by the \ncounterparty less the unsegregated collateral posted by the institution. With respect to IA, NICA \ntakes into account the differential of IA required for the institution minus IA required for the \ncounterparty. [Basel Framework, CRE 52.17] \n \n113. For margined trades, the replacement cost is:  \nRC = max{V – C; TH + MTA – NICA;0} \nWhere: V and C are defined as in the unmargined formulation, except that C now includes the \nnet variation margin amount, where the amount received by the institution is accounted with a \npositive sign and the amount posted by the institution is accounted with a negative sign, TH is \nthe positive threshold before the counterparty must send the institution collateral, and MTA is \nthe minimum transfer amount applicable to the counterparty. [Basel Framework, CRE 52.18] \n \n114. TH + MTA – NICA represents the largest exposure that would not trigger a VM call and \nit contains levels of collateral that need always to be maintained. For example, without initial \nmargin or IA, the greatest exposure that would not trigger a variation margin call is the threshold \nplus any minimum transfer amount. In the adapted formulation, NICA is subtracted from TH + \nMTA. This makes the calculation more accurate by fully reflecting both the actual level of \nexposure that would not trigger a margin call and the effect of collateral held and/or posted by an \ninstitution.

The PFE component \nalso reflects the risk-reducing property of excess collateral. [Basel Framework, CRE 52.21] \n117. For prudential reasons and in line with Basel Committee direction, OSFI applied a \nmultiplier to the PFE component that decreases as excess collateral increases, without reaching \nzero (the multiplier is floored at 5% of the PFE add-on). When the collateral held is less than the \nnet market value of the derivative contracts (“under-collateralization”), the current replacement \ncost is positive and the multiplier is equal to one (i.e. the PFE component is equal to the full \nvalue of the aggregate add-on). Where the collateral held is greater than the net market value of \nthe derivative contracts (“over-collateralization”), the current replacement cost is zero and the \nmultiplier is less than one (i.e. the PFE component is less than the full value of the aggregate \nadd-on).

For more complex trades that may have more than one risk driver (e.g., multi-asset or \nhybrid derivatives), institutions must take sensitivities and volatility of the underlying into \naccount for determining the primary risk driver.  \nOSFI may also require more complex trades to be allocated to more than one asset class, \nresulting in the same position being included in multiple classes. In this case, for each asset class \nto which the position is allocated, institutions must determine appropriately the sign and delta \nadjustment of the relevant risk driver. \n[Basel Framework, CRE 52.27 and 52.28] \n \n7.1.7.6 General steps for calculating the add-on \n \n122. For each transaction, the primary risk factor or factors need to be determined and \nattributed to one or more of the five asset classes: interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, equity \nor commodity. The add-on for each asset class is calculated using asset-class-specific formulas \nthat represent a stylized Effective EPE calculation under the assumption that all trades in the \nasset class have zero current mark-to-market value (i.e. they are at-the-money). [Basel \nFramework, CRE 52.29] \n123. Although the add-on formulas are asset class-specific, they have a number of features in \ncommon. To determine the add-on, transactions in each asset class are subject to adjustment in \nthe following general steps: \n1) The effective notional (D) must be calculated for each derivative (i.e. each individual \ntrade) in the netting set. The effective notional is a measure of the sensitivity of the trade \nto movements in the underlying risk factors (i.e. interest rates, exchange rates, credit \nspreads, equity prices and commodity prices). The effective notional is calculated as the \nproduct of the following parameters (i.e. D = d × MF × δ): \na. The adjustment notional (d). The adjusted notional is a measure of the size of \nthe trade. For derivatives in the foreign exchange asset class this is simply the \nnotional value of the foreign currency leg of the derivative contracted, converted \nto the domestic currency. For derivatives in the equity and commodity asset \nclasses, it is simply the current price of the relevant share or unit of commodity \nmultiplied by the number of shares/units that the derivative references. For \nderivatives in the interest rate and credit asset classes, the notional amount is \nadjusted by a measure of the duration of the instrument to account for the fact that \nthe value of the instruments with longer durations are more sensitive to \nmovements in underlying risk factors (i.e. interest rates and credit spreads). \nb. The maturity factor (MF). The maturity factor is a parameter that takes account \nof the time period over which the potential future exposure is calculated. The \ncalculation of the maturity factor varies depending on whether the netting set is \nmargined or unmargined.  \nc. The supervisory delta (δ). The supervisory delta ensures the effective notional \ntakes into account the direction of the trade, i.e. whether the trade is long or short, \nby having a positive or negative sign. It is also takes into account whether the",

The \nsupervisory factor is the supervisory specified change in value of the underlying risk \nfactor on which the potential future exposure calculation is based, which has been \ncalibrated to take into account the volatility of underlying risk factors. \n3) The trades within each asset class are separated into supervisory specified hedging sets. \nThe purpose of the hedging sets is to group together trades within the netting set where \nlong and short positions should be permitted to offset each other in the calculation of the \npotential future exposure. \n4) Aggregation formulas are applied to aggregate the effective notionals and supervisory \nfactors across all trades within each hedging set and finally at the asset-class level to give \nthe asset class level add-on. The method of aggregation varies between assets classes and \nfor credit, equity and commodity derivatives. It also involves the application of \nsupervisory correlation parameters to capture diversification of the trades and basis risk. \n [Basel Framework, CRE 52.30] \n7.1.7.7 Time Period Parameters Mi, Ei, Si, and Ti \n124. Four time period parameters are used in the SA-CCR (all expressed in years): \n• For all asset classes, the maturity Mi of a contract is the time period (starting today) until \nthe latest day when the contract may still be active. This time period appears in the \nmaturity factor defined in paragraphs 139 to 144 that scales down adjusted notional for \nunmargined trades for all asset classes. If a derivative contract has another derivative \ncontract as its underlying (for example, a swaption) and may be physically exercised into \nthe underlying contract (i.e., an institution would assume a position in the underlying \ncontract in the event of exercise), then maturity of the contract is the time period until the \nfinal settlement date of the underlying derivative contract.  \n• For interest rate and credit derivatives, S\ni is the period of time (starting today) until the \nstart of the time period referenced by an interest rate or credit contract. If the derivative \nreferences the value of another interest rate or credit instrument (e.g., swaption or bond \noption), the time period must be determined on the basis of the underlying instrument. S\ni \nappears in the definition of supervisory duration defined in paragraph 126.  \n• For interest rate and credit derivatives, Ei is the period of time (starting today) until the \nend of the time period referenced by an interest rate or credit contract.

For foreign exchange derivatives, the adjusted notional is defined as the notional of the \nforeign currency leg of the contract, converted to the domestic currency. If both legs of a foreign \nexchange derivative are denominated in currencies other than the domestic currency, the notional \namount of each leg is converted to the domestic currency and the leg with the larger domestic \ncurrency value is the adjusted notional amount.

For equity and commodity derivatives, the adjusted notional is defined as the product of \nthe current price of one unit of the stock or commodity (e.g., a share of equity or barrel of oil) \nand the number of units referenced by the trade. For equity and commodity volatility \ntransactions, the underlying volatility or variance referenced by the transactions should replace \nthe unit price and the contractual notional should replace the number of units. \n[Basel Framework, CRE52.36] \n \n130. In many cases the trade notional amount is stated clearly and fixed until maturity. When \nthis is not the case, institutions must use the following rules to determine the trade notional \namount. \n• Where the notional is a formula of market values, the institution must enter the current \nmarket values to determine the trade notional amount.  \n• For all interest rate and credit derivatives with variable notional amounts specified in the \ncontract (such as amortizing and accreting swaps), institutions must use the average \nnotional over the remaining life of the swap as the trade notional amount. The average \nshould be calculated as “time weighted”. The averaging described in this paragraph does \nnot cover transactions where the notional varies due to price changes (typically FX, \nequity and commodity derivatives). \n• Leveraged swaps must be converted to the notional of the equivalent unleveraged swap, \nthat is, where all rates in a swap are multiplied by a factor, the stated notional must be \nmultiplied by the factor on the interest rates to determine the trade notional amount.  \n• For a derivative contract with multiple exchanges of principal, the notional is multiplied \nby the number of exchanges of principal in the derivative contract to determine the trade \nnotional amount.  \n• For a derivative contract that is structured such that on specified dates any outstanding \nexposure is settled and the terms are reset so that the fair value of the contract is zero, the \nremaining maturity equals the time until the next reset date.  \n \n26  There is a distinction between the time period of the underlying transaction and the remaining maturity of the \nderivative contract.

In the \ncase of Asian options, the underlying price must be set equal to the current value of the \naverage used in the payoff. In the case of American and Bermudan options, the latest \nallowed exercise date must be used as the exercise date \niT  in the formula.  \nFor Bermudan swaptions, the start date iS  must be equal to the earliest allowed exercise \ndate, while the end date iE  must be equal to the end date of the underlying swap. \n• For digital options (also known as binary options), the payoff of each digital option \n(bought or sold) with strike \niK  must be approximated via the “collar” combination of \nbought and sold European options of the same type (call or put) with the strikes set equal \nto \n0.95 iK⋅  and 1.05 iK⋅ .

The combined effective notional of the commodity type \n(EN\nComType) is calculated by adding together the trade level effective notionals calculated \nin step 1 that reference the commodity type. \n(4) Step 4: Calculate the add-on for each commodity type (AddOnComType) within each \nhedging set by multiplying the combined effective notional for that commodity calculated \nin step 3 by the supervisory factor that is specified for that commodity type (SF\nComType). \nThe supervisory factors are set out in Table 2 in paragraph 162 and are set to 40% for \nelectricity derivatives and 18% for derivatives that reference all other types of \ncommodities. \n(5) Step 5: Calculate the add-on for each of the four commodity hedging sets (AddOnHS) by \nusing the formula that follows. In the formula the summations are across all commodity \ntypes within the hedging set, AddOnComType is the add-on amount calculated in step 4 for \neach commodity type and ρComType is the supervisory prescribed correlation factor \ncorresponding to the commodity type.

For example crude oil could be a commodity \ntype within the energy hedging set, but in certain cases this definition could omit a substantial \nbasis risk between different types of crude oil (West Texas Intermediate, Brent, Saudi Light, etc). \nAlso, the four commodity type hedging sets have been defined without regard to characteristics \nsuch as location and quality.

If a single margin agreement applies to several netting sets, special treatment is \nnecessary because it is problematic to allocate the common collateral to individual netting sets. \nThe replacement cost at any given time is determined by the sum of two terms. The first term is \nequal to the unmargined current exposure of the institution to the counterparty aggregated across \nall netting sets within the margin agreement reduced by the positive current net collateral (i.e. \ncollateral is subtracted only when the institution is a net holder of collateral). The second term is \nnon-zero only when the institution is a net poster of collateral: it is equal to the current net posted \ncollateral (if there is any) reduced by the unmargined current exposure of the counterparty to the \ninstitution aggregated across all netting sets within the margin agreement.

In all cases, any assets or collateral posted must, from the perspective of the institution \nposting such collateral, receive the risk weights that otherwise applies to such assets or collateral \nunder the capital adequacy framework, regardless of the fact that such assets have been posted as \ncollateral.\n43 That is, collateral posted must receive the banking book or trading book treatment it \nwould receive if it had not been posted to the CCP. [Basel Framework, CRE 54.18] \n186. In addition to the requirements in paragraph 185 above, the posted assets or collateral \nare subject to counterparty credit risk requirements, regardless of whether they are in the banking \nor trading book. This includes the increase in the counterparty credit risk exposure due to the \napplication of haircuts. The counterparty credit risk requirements arise where assets or collateral \nof a clearing member or client are posted with a CCP or a clearing member and are not held in a \nbankruptcy remote manner. In such cases, the institution posting such assets or collateral must \nalso recognize the credit risk based upon the assets or collateral being exposed to risk of loss \nbased on the creditworthiness of the entity holding such assets or collateral, as described further \nbelow. [Basel Framework, CRE 54.19] \n187. Where such collateral is included in the definition of trade exposures and the entity \nholding the collateral is the CCP, the following risk weights apply where the assets or collateral \nis not held on a bankruptcy-remote basis: \n(1) For institutions that are clearing members a risk-weight of 2% applies. \n(2) For institutions that are clients of clearing members: \na) A 2% risk weight applies if the conditions in paragraph 181 and 182 are met; or \nb) A 4% risk weight applied if the conditions in paragraph 183 are met \n[Basel Framework, CRE 54.20] \n188. Where such collateral is included in the definition of trades exposures, there is no \ncapital requirement for counterparty credit risk exposures if the collateral is: (a) held by a \ncustodian;\n44 and (b) bankruptcy remote from the CCP. Regarding this paragraph, all forms of \ncollateral are included, such as: cash, securities, other pledged assets, and excess initial or \nvariation margin, also called overcollateralization, that is held by a custodian, and is bankruptcy \nremote from the CCP, is not subject to a capital requirement for counterparty credit risk exposure \n \n43  Collateral posted must receive the banking book or trading book treatment it would receive if it had not been \nposted to the CCP. In addition, this collateral is subject to the CCR framework of the Basel rules, regardless of \nwhether it is in the banking or trading book. This includes the increase due to haircuts under either the \nstandardized supervisory haircuts or the own estimates.   \n44  In this paragraph, the word “custodian” may include a trustee, agent, pledgee, secured creditor or any other  \nperson that holds property in a way that does not give such person a beneficial interest in such property and will \nnot result in such property being subject to legally-enforceable claims by such persons creditors, or to a court-\nordered stay of the return of such property, if such person becomes insolvent or bankrupt.",

Where a default fund is shared between products or types of business with settlement \nrisk only (e.g., equities and bonds) and products or types of business which give rise to \ncounterparty credit risk (i.e., OTC derivatives, exchange-traded derivatives, SFTs or long \nsettlement transactions), all of the default fund contributions will receive the risk weight \ndetermined according to the formulae and methodology set forth below, without apportioning to \ndifferent classes or types of business or products. However, where the default fund contributions \nfrom clearing members are segregated by product types and only accessible for specific product \ntypes, the capital requirements for those default fund exposures determined according to the \nformulae and methodology set forth below must be calculated for each specific product giving \nrise to counterparty credit risk. In case the CCP’s prefunded own resources are shared among \nproduct types, the CCP will have to allocate those funds to each of the calculations, in proportion \nto the respective product specific EAD. [Basel Framework, CRE 54.24] \n192. Whenever an institution is required to capitalize for exposures arising from default fund \ncontributions to a QCCP, clearing member institutions will apply the following approach. [Basel \nFramework, CRE 54.25] \n193. Clearing member institutions will apply a risk weight to their default fund contributions \ndetermined according to a risk sensitive formula that considers (i) the size and quality of a \nqualifying CCP’s financial resources, (ii) the counterparty credit risk exposures of such CCP, \nand (iii) the application of such financial resources via the CCP’s loss bearing waterfall, in the \ncase of one or more clearing member defaults. The clearing member institution’s risk sensitive \ncapital requirement for its default fund contribution (𝐾𝐾\n𝐶𝐶𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖) must be calculated using the \nformulae and methodology set forth below.

The first step in calculating the clearing member institution’s capital requirement for its \ndefault fund contribution is to calculate the hypothetical capital requirement of the CCP \n(K\nCCP) due to its counterparty credit risk exposures to all of its clearing members and their \nclients. KCCP is a hypothetical capital requirement for a CCP, calculated on a consistent basis \nfor the sole purpose of determining the capitalization of clearing member default fund \ncontributions; it does not represent the actual capital requirements for a CCP which may be \ndetermine by a CCP and its supervisor.

Transactions where cash is paid without \nreceipt of the corresponding receivable (securities, foreign currencies, gold, or commodities) or, \nconversely, deliverables were delivered without receipt of the corresponding cash payment (non-\nDvP, or free-delivery) expose firms to a risk of loss on the full amount of cash paid or \ndeliverables delivered.
