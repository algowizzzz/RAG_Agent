For reference, the \nBasel paragraph numbers that are associated with the text appearing in this chapter are \nindicated in square brackets at the end of each paragraph.\n2 \n \n7.1. Treatment of counterparty credit risk and cross-product netting \n \n2. This rule identifies permissible methods for estimating the Exposure at Default (EAD) \nor the exposure amount for instruments with counterparty credit risk under this guideline.\n3  \nInstitutions may seek OSFI approval to make use of an Internal Modelling Method (IMM) \nmeeting the requirements and specifications identified herein. As an alternative institutions may \nalso use the Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR). [Basel Framework, \nCRE 53.1] \n7.1.1 Definitions and general terminology \n3. This section defines terms that will be used throughout this chapter. \n \n7.1.1.1 General terms \n \n‚Ä¢ Counterparty Credit Risk (CCR) is the risk that the counterparty to a transaction could \ndefault before the final settlement of the transaction's cash flows. An economic loss \nwould occur if the transactions or portfolio of transactions with the counterparty has a \npositive economic value at the time of default. Unlike an institution‚Äôs exposure to credit \nrisk through a loan, where the exposure to credit risk is unilateral and only the lending \ninstitution faces the risk of loss, CCR creates a bilateral risk of loss: the market value of \nthe transaction can be positive or negative to either counterparty to the transaction. The \nmarket value is uncertain and can vary over time with the movement of underlying \nmarket factors. \n‚Ä¢ A central counterparty (CCP) is a clearing house that interposes itself between \ncounterparties to contracts traded in one or more financial markets, becoming the buyer \nto every seller and the seller to every buyer and thereby ensuring the future performance \nof open contracts. A CCP becomes a counterparty to trades with market participants \nthrough novation, an open offer system, or another legally binding arrangement. For the \npurposes of the capital framework, a CCP is a financial institution.   \n‚Ä¢ A qualifying central counterparty (QCCP) is an entity that is licensed to operate as a \nCCP (including a license granted by way of confirming an exemption), and is permitted \nby the appropriate regulator/overseer to operate as such with respect to the products \n \n1    The Basel Framework  \n2  Following the format: [Basel Framework XXX yy.zz]. \n3 In this document, the terms ‚Äúexposure at default‚Äù and ‚Äúexposure amount‚Äù are used together in order to identify \nmeasures of exposure under both an internal ratings-based (IRB) and a standardized approach for credit risk.",

This is subject to the provision that the CCP is based and prudentially supervised \nin a jurisdiction where the relevant regulator/overseer has established, and publicly \nindicated that it applies to the CCP on an ongoing basis, domestic rules and regulations \nthat are consistent with the CPSS-IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures. \nWhere the CCP is in a jurisdiction that does not have a CCP regulator applying the \nPrinciples to the CCP, then OSFI may make the determination of whether the CCP meets \nthis definition.  \nIn addition, for a CCP to be considered as a QCCP, the requirements in paragraph 204 \nmust be met to permit each clearing member institution to calculate its capital \nrequirement for its default fund contributions.  \n‚Ä¢ A clearing member is a member of, or a direct participant in, a CCP that is entitled to \nenter into a transaction with the CCP, regardless of whether it enters into trades with a \nCCP for its own hedging, investment or speculative purposes or whether it also enters \ninto trades as a financial intermediary between the CCP and other market participants.\n4  \n‚Ä¢ A client is a party to a transaction with a CCP through either a clearing member acting as \na financial intermediary, or a clearing member guaranteeing the performance of the client \nto the CCP.  \n‚Ä¢ Initial margin means a clearing member‚Äôs or client‚Äôs funded collateral posted to the CCP \nto mitigate the potential future exposure of the CCP to the clearing member arising from \nthe possible future change in the value of their transactions. For the purposes of the \ncalculation of counterparty credit risk capital requirements, initial margin does not \ninclude contributions to a CCP for mutualized loss sharing arrangements (i.e., in case a \nCCP uses initial margin to mutualize losses among the clearing members, it will be \ntreated as a default fund exposure). Initial margin may include excess collateral, in cases \nwhere the CCP may prevent the clearing member and the clearing member may prevent \nthe client from withdrawing the excess.   \n‚Ä¢ Variation margin means a clearing member‚Äôs or client‚Äôs funded collateral posted on a \ndaily or intraday basis to a CCP based upon price movements of their transactions.  \n‚Ä¢ Trade exposures (in section 7.1.8) include the current\n5 and potential future exposure of a \nclearing member or a client to a CCP arising from OTC derivatives, exchange traded \nderivatives transactions or securities financing transactions (SFTs), as well as initial \nmargin.  \n‚Ä¢ Default funds, also known as clearing deposits or guaranty fund contributions (or any \nother names), are clearing members‚Äô funded or unfunded contributions towards, or \nunderwriting of, a CCP‚Äôs mutualized loss sharing arrangements.

OSFI \nshould be consulted to determine the treatment of this initial margin and default fund contributions.    \n5  For the purposes of this definition, the current exposure of a clearing member includes the variation margin due \nto the clearing member but not yet received.",

Margin lending \ntransactions do not include other loans that happen to be secured by securities collateral. \nGenerally, in margin lending transactions, the loan amount is collateralized by securities \nwhose value is greater than the amount of the loan. \n[Basel Framework, CRE 50.14] \n \n7.1.1.3 Netting sets, hedging sets, and related terms \n \n‚Ä¢ Netting Set is a group of transactions with a single counterparty that are subject to a \nlegally enforceable bilateral netting arrangement and for which netting is recognized for \nregulatory capital purposes under Chapter 4 or the Cross-Product Netting Rules set forth \nin this chapter. Each transaction that is not subject to a legally enforceable bilateral \nnetting arrangement that is recognized for regulatory capital purposes should be \ninterpreted as its own netting set for the purpose of these rules. \n‚Ä¢ Hedging Set is a set of transactions within a single netting set within which full or partial \noffsetting is recognized for purposes of calculating the potential future exposure (PFE) \nadd-on of the SA-CCR. .",

Current exposure is often also called Replacement Cost.  \n‚Ä¢ Peak Exposure is a high percentile (typically 95% or 99%) of the distribution of \nexposures at any particular future date before the maturity date of the longest transaction \nin the netting set. A peak exposure value is typically generated for many future dates up \nuntil the longest maturity date of transactions in the netting set. \n‚Ä¢ Expected Exposure is the mean (average) of the distribution of exposures at any \nparticular future date before the longest-maturity transaction in the netting set matures. \nAn expected exposure value is typically generated for many future dates up until the \nlongest maturity date of transactions in the netting set. \n‚Ä¢ Effective Expected Exposure at a specific date is the maximum expected exposure that \noccurs at that date or any prior date. Alternatively, it may be defined for a specific date as \nthe greater of the expected exposure at that date, or the effective exposure at the previous \ndate. In effect, the Effective Expected Exposure is the Expected Exposure that is \nconstrained to be non-decreasing over time. \n‚Ä¢ Expected Positive Exposure (EPE) is the weighted average over time of expected \nexposures where the weights are the proportion that an individual expected exposure \nrepresents of the entire time interval. When calculating the minimum capital requirement, \nthe average is taken over the first year or, if all the contracts in the netting set mature \nbefore one year, over the time period of the longest-maturity contract in the netting set.  \n‚Ä¢ Effective Expected Positive Exposure (Effective EPE) is the weighted average over \ntime of effective expected exposure over the first year, or, if all the contracts in the \nnetting set mature before one year, over the time period of the longest-maturity contract \nin the netting set where the weights are the proportion that an individual expected \nexposure represents of the entire time interval.  \n‚Ä¢ Credit Valuation Adjustment is an adjustment to the mid-market valuation of the \nportfolio of trades with a counterparty.

This method is to be used for exposures arising from OTC \nderivatives, exchange-traded derivatives and long settlement transactions. This method must be \nused if the bank does not have approval to use the internal model method (IMM).  \n(2) The simple approach or comprehensive approach to the recognition of collateral, which are \nboth set out in the credit risk mitigation section of the standardized approach to credit risk (see \nChapter 4, section 4.3).

For margined counterparties, the model may also capture future collateral \nmovements. Institutions may include eligible financial collateral as defined in section 4.3.3 and \nChapter 9 in their forecasting distributions for changes in the market value of the netting set, if \nthe quantitative, qualitative and data requirements for internal model method are met for the \ncollateral.

To determine the default risk capital charge for counterparty credit risk for exposures \nsubject to the IMM, institutions must use the greater of the portfolio-level capital charge (not \nincluding the CVA charge in Chapter 8) based on Effective EPE using current market data and \nthe portfolio-level capital charge based on Effective EPE using a stress calibration. The stress \ncalibration should be a single consistent stress calibration for the whole portfolio of \ncounterparties. The greater of Effective EPE using current market data and the stress calibration \nshould be applied on a total portfolio level and not on a counterparty by counterparty basis. \n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.7] \n \n22. OSFI expects institutions to have in place a policy for verifying the adequacy of, and \nupdating, their choice of stress period. This policy would have to be approved in advance by \nOSFI as part of the IMM model approval process. Changes to this policy would constitute a \nmajor modification of the IMM model. \n \n23. To the extent that an institution recognizes collateral in exposure amount or EAD via \ncurrent exposure, an institution would not be permitted to recognize the benefits in its estimates \nof LGD. As a result, the institution would be required to use an LGD of an otherwise similar \nuncollateralized facility. In other words, it would be required to use an LGD that does not \ninclude collateral that is already included in EAD. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.8] \n \n24.

Furthermore, for single-name credit default swaps \nwhere there exists a legal connection between the counterparty and the underlying issuer, and \nwhere SWWR has been identified, EAD in respect of such swap counterparty exposure equals \nthe full expected loss in the remaining fair value of the underlying instruments assuming the \nunderlying issuer is in liquidation. The use of the full expected loss in remaining fair value of the \nunderlying instrument allows the institution to recognize, in respect of such swap, the market \nvalue that has been lost already and any expected recoveries. Accordingly LGD for Advanced or \nFoundation IRB institutions must be set to 100% for such swap transactions.\n14 For institutions \nusing the standardized approach for credit risk, the risk weight to use is that of an unsecured \ntransaction. For equity derivatives, bond options, securities financing transactions etc. \nreferencing a single company where there exists a legal connection between the counterparty and \nthe underlying company, and where SWWR has been identified, EAD equals the value of the \ntransaction under the assumption of a jump-to-default of the underlying security. Inasmuch this \nmakes re-use of possibly existing (market risk) calculations (for IRC) that already contain an \nLGD assumption, the LGD must be set to 100%. LGD for Advanced and Foundation IRB banks \nwill be that of an unsecured exposure. For institutions using the standardized approach for credit \nrisk, the risk weight of an unsecured transaction should be used. \n \nThe counterparty credit risk arising from trades where SWWR has been identified can be \nmitigated through either prepayment or the collection of independent collateral amounts. If a \ncounterparty prepays the notional amount of the exposure for a trade where SWWR has been \n \n14  Note that the recoveries may also be possible on the underlying instrument beneath such swap.

The process for recognizing netting arrangements must require signoff \nby legal staff to verify the legal enforceability of netting and be input into the database by an \nindependent unit. The transmission of transaction terms and specifications data to the internal \nmodel must also be subject to internal audit and formal reconciliation processes must be in place \nbetween the internal model and source data systems to verify on an ongoing basis that \ntransaction terms and specifications are being reflected in EPE correctly or at least \nconservatively.

When the Effective EPE model is calibrated using historic market data, the institution \nmust employ current market data to compute current exposures and at least three years of \nhistorical data must be used to estimate parameters of the model. Alternatively, market implied \ndata may be used to estimate parameters of the model. In all cases, the data must be updated \nquarterly or more frequently if market conditions warrant. To calculate the Effective EPE using a \nstress calibration, the institution must also calibrate Effective EPE using three years of data that \ninclude a period of stress to the credit default spreads of an institution‚Äôs counterparties or \ncalibrate Effective EPE using market implied data from a suitable period of stress. The following \nprocess will be used to assess the adequacy of the stress calibration: \n‚Ä¢ The institution must demonstrate, at least quarterly, that the stress period coincides with a \nperiod of increased CDS or other credit spreads ‚Äì such as loan or corporate bond spreads \n‚Äì for a representative selection of the institution‚Äôs counterparties with traded credit \nspreads. In situations where the institution does not have adequate credit spread data for a \ncounterparty, the institution should map each counterparty to specific credit spread data \nbased on region, internal rating and business types. \n‚Ä¢ The exposure model for all counterparties must use data, either historic or implied, that \nincludes the data from the stressed credit period, and must use such data in a manner \nconsistent with the method used for the calibration of the Effective EPE model to current \ndata. \n [Basel Framework, CRE 53.52] \n \n73.

[Basel Framework, CRE 52.9] \n \nA. Formulation for unmargined transactions \n \n105. For unmargined transactions (that is, where VM is not exchanged, but collateral other \nthan VM may be present), RC is defined as the greater of: (i) the current market value of the \nderivative contracts less net haircut collateral held by the institution (if any), and (ii) zero. This is \nconsistent with the use of replacement cost as the measure of current exposure, meaning that \nwhen the institution owes the counterparty money it has no exposure to the counterparty if it can \ninstantly replace its trades and sell collateral at current market prices. Mathematically:   \n \nRC = max{V-C,0} \nwhere V is the value of the derivative transactions in the netting set and C is the haircut value of \nnet collateral held, which is calculated in accordance with the NICA methodology defined in \nparagraph 112. For this purpose, the value of non-cash collateral posted by the institution to its \ncounterparty is increased and the value of the non-cash collateral received by the institution from \nits counterparty is decreased using haircuts (which are the same as those that apply to repo-style \ntransactions) for the time periods described in paragraph 100.  \n[Basel Framework, CRE 52.10 and 52.11] \n \n106. In the above formulation, it is assumed that the replacement cost representing today‚Äôs \nexposure to the counterparty cannot go less than zero. However, institutions sometimes hold \nexcess collateral (even in the absence of a margin agreement) or have out-of-the-money trades \nwhich can further protect the institution from the increase of the exposure. As discussed in \nparagraphs 116 to 118, the SA-CCR would allow such over-collateralization and negative mark-\n \n22  Thus, if any of these supervisors is dissatisfied about enforceability under its laws, the netting contract or \nagreement will not meet this condition and neither counterparty could obtain supervisory benefit.",

For more complex trades that may have more than one risk driver (e.g., multi-asset or \nhybrid derivatives), institutions must take sensitivities and volatility of the underlying into \naccount for determining the primary risk driver.  \nOSFI may also require more complex trades to be allocated to more than one asset class, \nresulting in the same position being included in multiple classes. In this case, for each asset class \nto which the position is allocated, institutions must determine appropriately the sign and delta \nadjustment of the relevant risk driver. \n[Basel Framework, CRE 52.27 and 52.28] \n \n7.1.7.6 General steps for calculating the add-on \n \n122. For each transaction, the primary risk factor or factors need to be determined and \nattributed to one or more of the five asset classes: interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, equity \nor commodity. The add-on for each asset class is calculated using asset-class-specific formulas \nthat represent a stylized Effective EPE calculation under the assumption that all trades in the \nasset class have zero current mark-to-market value (i.e. they are at-the-money). [Basel \nFramework, CRE 52.29] \n123. Although the add-on formulas are asset class-specific, they have a number of features in \ncommon. To determine the add-on, transactions in each asset class are subject to adjustment in \nthe following general steps: \n1) The effective notional (D) must be calculated for each derivative (i.e. each individual \ntrade) in the netting set. The effective notional is a measure of the sensitivity of the trade \nto movements in the underlying risk factors (i.e. interest rates, exchange rates, credit \nspreads, equity prices and commodity prices). The effective notional is calculated as the \nproduct of the following parameters (i.e. D = d √ó MF √ó Œ¥): \na. The adjustment notional (d). The adjusted notional is a measure of the size of \nthe trade. For derivatives in the foreign exchange asset class this is simply the \nnotional value of the foreign currency leg of the derivative contracted, converted \nto the domestic currency. For derivatives in the equity and commodity asset \nclasses, it is simply the current price of the relevant share or unit of commodity \nmultiplied by the number of shares/units that the derivative references. For \nderivatives in the interest rate and credit asset classes, the notional amount is \nadjusted by a measure of the duration of the instrument to account for the fact that \nthe value of the instruments with longer durations are more sensitive to \nmovements in underlying risk factors (i.e. interest rates and credit spreads). \nb. The maturity factor (MF). The maturity factor is a parameter that takes account \nof the time period over which the potential future exposure is calculated. The \ncalculation of the maturity factor varies depending on whether the netting set is \nmargined or unmargined.  \nc. The supervisory delta (Œ¥). The supervisory delta ensures the effective notional \ntakes into account the direction of the trade, i.e. whether the trade is long or short, \nby having a positive or negative sign. It is also takes into account whether the",

The \nsupervisory factor is the supervisory specified change in value of the underlying risk \nfactor on which the potential future exposure calculation is based, which has been \ncalibrated to take into account the volatility of underlying risk factors. \n3) The trades within each asset class are separated into supervisory specified hedging sets. \nThe purpose of the hedging sets is to group together trades within the netting set where \nlong and short positions should be permitted to offset each other in the calculation of the \npotential future exposure. \n4) Aggregation formulas are applied to aggregate the effective notionals and supervisory \nfactors across all trades within each hedging set and finally at the asset-class level to give \nthe asset class level add-on. The method of aggregation varies between assets classes and \nfor credit, equity and commodity derivatives.

The average \nshould be calculated as ‚Äútime weighted‚Äù. The averaging described in this paragraph does \nnot cover transactions where the notional varies due to price changes (typically FX, \nequity and commodity derivatives). \n‚Ä¢ Leveraged swaps must be converted to the notional of the equivalent unleveraged swap, \nthat is, where all rates in a swap are multiplied by a factor, the stated notional must be \nmultiplied by the factor on the interest rates to determine the trade notional amount.  \n‚Ä¢ For a derivative contract with multiple exchanges of principal, the notional is multiplied \nby the number of exchanges of principal in the derivative contract to determine the trade \nnotional amount.  \n‚Ä¢ For a derivative contract that is structured such that on specified dates any outstanding \nexposure is settled and the terms are reset so that the fair value of the contract is zero, the \nremaining maturity equals the time until the next reset date.  \n \n26  There is a distinction between the time period of the underlying transaction and the remaining maturity of the \nderivative contract.

The formula to recognized partial offsetting in step 4 above, is a single-factor model, \nwhich divides the risk of the credit derivative asset class into a systemic component and an \nidiosyncratic component. The entity level add-ons are allowed to offset each other fully in the \nsystemic component, whereas, there is no offsetting benefit in the idiosyncratic component. \nThese two components are weighted by a correlation factor which determines the degree of \noffsetting/hedging benefit within the credit derivative asset class. The higher the correlation \nfactor, the higher the importance of the systemic component, hence the higher the degree of \noffsetting benefits. [Basel Framework, CRE 52.62] \n \n153. It should be noted that a higher or lower correlation does not necessarily mean a higher \nor lower capital charge. For portfolios consisting of long and short credit positions, a high \ncorrelation factor would reduce the charge. For portfolios consisting exclusively of long \npositions (or short positions), a higher correlation factor would increase the charge. If most of the \nrisk consists of systematic risk, then individual reference entities would be highly correlated and \nlong and short positions should offset each other. If, however, most of the risk is idiosyncratic to \na reference entity, then individual long and short positions would not be effective hedges for \neach other. [Basel Framework, CRE 52.63] \n154. The use of a single hedging set for credit derivatives implies that credit derivatives from \ndifferent industries and regions are equally able to offset the systematic component of an \nexposure, although they would not be able to offset the idiosyncratic portion. This approach \nrecognizes that meaningful distinctions between industries and/or regions are complex and \ndifficult to analyze for global conglomerates.

Institutions are not permitted to make any modelling assumptions in the calculation of \nthe PFE add-ons, including estimating individual volatilities or taking publicly available \nestimates of beta. This is a pragmatic approach to ensure a consistent implementation across \njurisdictions but also to keep the add-on calculation relatively simple and prudent. Therefore, \nonly two values of supervisory factors have been defined for equity derivatives, one for single \nentities and one for indices.  \n \n38 The beta of an individual equity measures the volatility of the stock relative to a broad market index.

[BCBS June 2006 Annex 3 par 4] and [Basel Framework, CRE 70.7] \n \n215. Failure of a counterparty to settle a trade in itself will not be deemed a default for \npurposes of credit risk under this guideline.  [Basel Framework, CRE 70.8]  \n \n216. In applying a risk weight to failed free-delivery exposures, institutions using the IRB \napproach for credit risk may assign PDs to counterparties for which they have no other banking \nbook exposure on the basis of the counterparty‚Äôs external rating. Institutions using the Advanced \nIRB approach may use a 45% LGD in lieu of estimating LGDs so long as they apply it to all \nfailed trade exposures. Alternatively, institutions using the IRB approach may opt to apply the \nstandardized approach risk weights or a 100% risk weight.  [Basel Framework, CRE 70.10] \n \n48  For the purpose of this guideline, DvP transactions include payment-versus-payment (PvP) transactions. \n49  An exposure value of zero for counterparty credit risk can be attributed to payment transactions (e.g. funds \ntransfer transactions) and other spot transactions that are outstanding with a central counterparty (e.g. a clearing \nhouse), when the central counterparty CCR exposures with all participants in its arrangements are fully \ncollateralized on a daily basis.",

For DvP transactions, if the payments have not yet taken place five business days after \nthe settlement date, firms must calculate a capital charge by multiplying the positive current \nexposure of the transaction by the appropriate factor, according to the Table 3. \n \n \nTable 3 \nNumber of working days after the \nagreed settlement date \nCorresponding risk multiplier \nFrom 5 to 15 8% \nFrom 16 to 30 50% \nFrom 31 to 45 75% \n46 or more 100% \n[Basel Framework, CRE 70.9] \n \n218. For non-DvP transactions (i.e., free deliveries), after the first contractual \npayment/delivery leg, the institution that has made the payment will treat its exposure as a loan if \nthe second leg has not been received by the end of the business day.\n50 This means that an \ninstitution under the IRB approach will apply the appropriate IRB formula set out in this \nguideline, for the exposure to the counterparty, in the same way as it does for all other banking \nbook exposures. Similarly, institutions under the standardized approach will use the standardized \nrisk weights set forth in this guideline. However, when exposures are not material, institutions \nmay choose to apply a uniform 100% risk-weight to these exposures, in order to avoid the \nburden of a full credit assessment. If five business days after the second contractual \npayment/delivery date the second leg has not yet effectively taken place, the institution that has \nmade the first payment leg will deduct from capital the full amount of the value transferred plus \nreplacement cost, if any. This treatment will apply until the second payment/delivery leg is \neffectively made.  [Basel Framework, CRE 70.4] \n \n \n50  If the dates when two payment legs are made are the same according to the time zones where each payment is \nmade, it is deemed that they are settled on the same day. For example, if a bank in Tokyo transfers Yen on day X \n(Japan Standard Time) and receives corresponding US Dollar via CHIPS on day X (US Eastern Standard Time), \nthe settlement is deemed to take place on the same value date.",

Market Risk Terminology, Definition and Application  \n9.1.1 MARKET RISK TERMINOLOGY \nThis section provides a high-level description of terminologies used in the market risk \nframeworks. \n9.1.1.1  General Terminology \n4. Market risk: the risk of losses in on- and off-balance sheet risk positions arising from \nmovements in market prices. [Basel Framework, MAR10.1] \n5. Notional value: the notional value of a derivative instrument is equal to the number of \nunits underlying the instrument multiplied by the current market value of each unit of the \nunderlying. [Basel Framework, MAR10.2] \n6. Trading desk: a group of traders or trading accounts in a business line within an \ninstitution that follows defined trading strategies with the goal of generating revenues or \nmaintaining market presence from assuming and managing risk. [Basel Framework, MAR10.3] \n7. Pricing model: a model that is used to determine the value of an instrument (mark-to-\nmarket or mark-to-model) as a function of pricing parameters or to determine the change in the \nvalue of an instrument as a function of risk factors. A pricing model may be the combination of \nseveral calculations; e.g. a first valuation technique to compute a price, followed by valuation \nadjustments for risks that are not incorporated in the first step. [Basel Framework, MAR10.4] \n8. Rating Agencies: OSFI conducted a process to determine which of the major international \nrating agencies would be recognized as an eligible external credit assessment institution under \nthis chapter. As a result of this process, OSFI will permit institutions to recognize credit ratings \n \n1 Minimum capital requirements for market risk (which includes previously published frequently asked questions  \n  (FAQs). \n2 Following the format: [Basel Framework, XXX yy.zz].",

Financial instrument: any contract that gives rise to both a financial asset of one entity \nand a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Financial instruments include \nprimary financial instruments (or cash instruments) and derivative financial instruments. [Basel \nFramework, MAR10.5]  \n10. Instrument: the term used to describe financial instruments, instruments on foreign \nexchange (FX) and commodities. [Basel Framework, MAR10.6] \n11. Embedded derivative: a component of a financial instrument that includes a non-\nderivative host contract. For example, the conversion option in a convertible bond is an \nembedded derivative. [Basel Framework, MAR10.7] \n12. Look-through approach: an approach in which an institution determines the relevant \ncapital requirements for a position that has underlyings (such as an index instrument, multi-\nunderlying option, or an equity investment in a fund) as if the underlying positions were held \ndirectly by the institution. [Basel Framework, MAR10.8] \n9.1.1.3  Terminology for Market Risk Capital Requirement Calculations  \n13. Risk factor: a principal determinant of the change in value of an instrument (e.g. an \nexchange rate or interest rate). [Basel Framework, MAR10.9] \n14. Risk position: the portion of the current value of an instrument that may be subject to \nlosses due to movements in a risk factor. For example, a bond denominated in a currency \ndifferent to an institution‚Äôs reporting currency has risk positions in general interest rate risk, \ncredit spread risk (non-securitization) and FX risk, where the risk positions are the potential \nlosses to the current value of the instrument that could occur due to a change in the relevant \nunderlying risk factors (interest rates, credit spreads, or exchange rates). [Basel Framework, \nMAR10.10] \n15. Risk bucket: a defined group of risk factors with similar characteristics. [Basel \nFramework, MAR10.11] \n16. Risk class: a defined list of risks that are used as the basis for calculating market risk \ncapital requirements: general interest rate risk, credit spread risk (non-securitization), credit \nspread risk (securitization: non-correlation trading portfolio), credit spread risk (securitization: \ncorrelation trading portfolio), FX risk, equity risk and commodity risk.

Sensitivity: an institution‚Äôs estimate of the change in value of an instrument due to a small \nchange in one of its underlying risk factors. Delta and vega risks are sensitivities. [Basel \nFramework, MAR10.13] \n18. Delta risk: the linear estimate of the change in value of a financial instrument due to a \nmovement in the value of a risk factor. The risk factor could be the price of an equity or \ncommodity, or a change in an interest rate, credit spread or FX rate. [Basel Framework, \nMAR10.14] \n19. Vega risk: the potential loss resulting from the change in value of a derivative due to a \nchange in the implied volatility of its underlying. [Basel Framework, MAR10.15] \n20. Curvature risk: the additional potential loss beyond delta risk due to a change in a risk \nfactor for financial instruments with optionality. In the standardized approach in the market risk \nframework, it is based on two stress scenarios involving an upward shock and a downward shock \nto each regulatory risk factor. [Basel Framework, MAR10.16]  \n21. Value at risk (VaR): a measure of the worst expected loss on a portfolio of instruments \nresulting from market movements over a given time horizon and a pre-defined confidence level. \n[Basel Framework, MAR10.17] \n22. Expected shortfall (ES): a measure of the average of all potential losses exceeding the \nVaR at a given confidence level. [Basel Framework, MAR10.18] \n23. Jump-to-default (JTD): the risk of a sudden default. JTD exposure refers to the loss that \ncould be incurred from a JTD event. [Basel Framework, MAR10.19] \n24.

Market risk is defined as the risk of losses arising from movements in market prices. The \nrisks subject to market risk capital requirements include but are not limited to: \n(1) default risk, interest rate risk, credit spread risk, equity risk, foreign exchange (FX) risk \nand commodities risk for trading book instruments; and \n(2) FX risk and commodities risk for banking book instruments. \n[Basel Framework, MAR11.1] \n41. Derivative, repurchase/reverse repurchase, securities lending and other transactions \nbooked in the trading book are subject to both the market risk and the counterparty credit risk \ncapital requirements. This is because they face the risk of loss due to market fluctuations in the \nvalue of the underlying instrument and due to the failure of the counterparty to the contract. The \ncounterparty risk weights used to calculate the credit risk capital requirements for these \ntransactions are those used for calculating the capital requirements in the banking book. \n42. All transactions, including forward sales and purchases, shall be included in the \ncalculation of capital requirements as of the date on which they were entered into. Although \nregular reporting will in principle take place only at intervals (quarterly in most countries), \ninstitutions are expected to manage their market risk in such a way that the capital requirements \nare being met on a continuous basis, including at the close of each business day. OSFI has at its \ndisposal a number of effective measures to ensure that institutions do not window-dress by \nshowing significantly lower market risk positions on reporting dates.

A trading book consists of all instruments that meet the specifications for trading book \ninstruments set out in paragraphs 59 through 70. All other instruments must be included in the \nbanking book. [Basel Framework, RBC25.1] \n59. Instruments comprise financial instruments, foreign exchange (FX), and commodities.

Financial instruments include primary \nfinancial instruments (or cash instruments) and derivative financial instruments. A financial asset \nis any asset that is cash, the right to receive cash or another financial asset or a commodity, or an \nequity instrument. A financial liability is the contractual obligation to deliver cash or another \nfinancial asset or a commodity. Commodities also include non-tangible (i.e. non-physical) goods \nsuch as electric power. \nThe CSR capital requirement applies to money market instruments to the extent such instruments \nare covered instruments (i.e. they meet the definition of instruments to be included in the trading \nbook as specified in paragraphs 59 through 70.

Institutions may only include a financial instrument, instruments on FX or commodity in \nthe trading book when there is no legal impediment against selling or fully hedging it. [Basel \nFramework, RBC25.3] \n61. Institutions must fair value daily any trading book instrument and recognize any \nvaluation change in the profit and loss (P&L) account. \nInstruments designated under the fair value option may be allocated to the trading book, but only \nif they comply with all the relevant requirements for trading book instruments set out in section \n9.2.

Any instrument an institution holds for one or more of the following purposes must, \nwhen it is first recognised on its books, be designated as a trading book instrument, unless \nspecifically otherwise provided for in paragraph 60 or paragraph 64: \n(1) short-term resale; \n(2) profiting from short-term price movements;  \n(3) locking in arbitrage profits; or \n(4) hedging risks that arise from instruments meeting (1), (2) or (3) above.",

This section provides institutions with guidance on prudent valuation for positions that \nare accounted for at fair value, whether they are in the trading book or in the banking book. This \nguidance is especially important for positions without actual market prices or observable inputs \nto valuation, as well as less liquid positions which raise OSFI concerns about prudent valuation. \nThe valuation guidance set forth below is not intended to require institutions to change valuation \nprocedures for financial reporting purposes. OSFI will assess an institution‚Äôs valuation \nprocedures for consistency with this guidance. One fact in OSFI‚Äôs assessment of whether an \ninstitution must take a valuation adjustment for regulatory purposes under paragraphs 104 to 107 \nshould be the degree of consistency between the institution‚Äôs valuation procedures and these \nguidelines. [Basel Framework, CAP50.1] \n95. A framework for prudent valuation practices should at a minimum include the following. \n[Basel Framework, CAP50.2] \n9.4.2 Systems and Controls \n96. Institutions must establish and maintain adequate systems and controls sufficient to give \nmanagement and OSFI the confidence that their valuation estimates are prudent and reliable. \nThese systems must be integrated with other risk management systems within the organization \n(such as credit analysis). Such systems must include: \n(1) Documented policies and procedures for the process of valuation. This includes clearly \ndefined responsibilities of the various areas involved in the determination of the \nvaluation, sources of market information and review of their appropriateness, guidelines \nfor the use of unobservable inputs reflecting the institution‚Äôs assumptions of what market \nparticipants would use in pricing the position, frequency of independent valuation, timing \nof closing prices, procedures for adjusting valuations, end of the month and ad-hoc \nverification procedures; and \n(2) Clear and independent (i.e. independent of front office) reporting lines for the department \naccountable for the valuation process. The reporting line should ultimately be to a main \nmember of senior management. \n[Basel Framework, CAP50.3] \n9.4.3 Valuation Methodologies \nMarking to market \n97.

[Basel \nFramework, CAP50.4] \n98. Institutions must mark-to-market as much as possible. The more prudent side of bid/offer \nshould be used unless the institution is a significant market maker in a particular position type \nand it can close out at mid-market. Institutions should maximise the use of relevant observable \ninputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs when estimating fair value using a valuation \ntechnique. However, observable inputs or transactions may not be relevant, such as in a forced \nliquidation or distressed sale, or transactions may not be observable, such as when markets are \ninactive. In such cases, the observable data should be considered, but may not be determinative. \n[Basel Framework, CAP50.5] \nMarking to model \n99. Only where marking-to-market is not possible should institutions mark-to-model, but this \nmust be demonstrated to be prudent. Marking-to-model is defined as any valuation which has to \nbe benchmarked, extrapolated or otherwise calculated from a market input. When marking to \nmodel, an extra degree of conservatism is appropriate. OSFI will consider the following in \nassessing whether a mark-to-model valuation is prudent: \n(1) Senior management should be aware of the elements of the trading book or other fair-\nvalued positions which are subject to mark to model and should understand the \nmateriality of the uncertainty this creates in the reporting of the risk/performance of the \nbusiness. \n(2) Market inputs should be sourced, to the extent possible, in line with market prices (as \ndiscussed above). The appropriateness of the market inputs for the particular position \nbeing valued should be reviewed regularly. \n(3) Where available, generally accepted valuation methodologies for particular products \nshould be used as far as possible. \n(4) Where the model is developed by the institution itself, it should be based on appropriate \nassumptions, which have been assessed and challenged by suitably qualified parties \nindependent of the development process. The model should be developed or approved \nindependently of the front office. It should be independently tested. This includes \nvalidating the mathematics, the assumptions and the software implementation. \n(5) There should be formal change control procedures in place and a secure copy of the \nmodel should be held and periodically used to check valuations. \n(6) Risk management should be aware of the weaknesses of the models used and how best to \nreflect those in the valuation output. \n(7) The model should be subject to periodic review to determine the accuracy of its \nperformance (e.g. assessing continued appropriateness of the assumptions, analysis of \nprofit and loss versus risk factors, comparison of actual close out values to model \noutputs).",

Independent price verification is distinct from daily mark-to-market. It is the process by \nwhich market prices or model inputs are regularly verified for accuracy. While daily marking-to-\nmarket may be performed by dealers, verification of market prices or model inputs should be \nperformed by a unit independent of the dealing room, at least monthly (or, depending on the \nnature of the market/trading activity, more frequently). It need not be performed as frequently as \ndaily mark-to-market, since the objective, i.e. independent, marking of positions, should reveal \nany error or bias in pricing, which should result in the elimination of inaccurate daily marks. \n[Basel Framework, CAP50.7] \n101. Independent price verification entails a higher standard of accuracy in that the market \nprices or model inputs are used to determine profit and loss figures, whereas daily marks are \nused primarily for management reporting in between reporting dates. For independent price \nverification, where pricing sources are more subjective, e.g. only one available broker quote, \nprudent measures such as valuation adjustments may be appropriate.

OSFI expects institutions using third-\nparty valuations to consider whether valuation adjustments are necessary. Such considerations \nare also necessary when marking to model. [Basel Framework, CAP50.9] \n103. OSFI expects the following valuation adjustments/reserves to be formally considered at a \nminimum: unearned credit spreads, close-out costs, operational risks, early termination, investing \nand funding costs, and future administrative costs and, where appropriate, model risk. OSFI also \nexpects that the valuation adjustment will be considered for positions individually (i.e. \nadjustments should be reflected in the valuation of the individual transactions) rather than on a \nportfolio level (i.e. adjustments are made in the form of a reserve for a portfolio of exposures and \nare not reflected in the valuation of the individual transactions). [Basel Framework, CAP50.10] \n9.4.5 Adjustment to the Current Valuation of Less Liquid Positions for Regulatory \nCapital Purposes \n104. Institutions must establish and maintain procedures for judging the necessity of and \ncalculating an adjustment to the current valuation of less liquid positions for regulatory capital \npurposes.

Bearing in mind that the assumptions made about liquidity in the market risk capital \nrequirement may not be consistent with the institution‚Äôs ability to sell or hedge out less liquid \npositions, where appropriate, institutions must take an adjustment to the current valuation of \nthese positions, and review their continued appropriateness on an on-going basis.

For complex products including, but not limited to, securitization exposures and n-th-to-\ndefault credit derivatives, institutions must explicitly assess the need for valuation adjustments to \nreflect two forms of model risk: the model risk associated with using a possibly incorrect \nvaluation methodology; and the risk associated with using unobservable (and possibly incorrect) \ncalibration parameters in the valuation model.

An institution must also determine its regulatory capital requirements for market risk \naccording to the standardized approach for market risk at the demand of OSFI. [Basel \nFramework, MAR20.3] \n9.5.1.2  Structure of the Standardized Approach \n111. The standardized approach capital requirement is the simple sum of three components: \nthe capital requirement under the sensitivities-based method, the default risk capital (DRC) \nrequirement and the residual risk add-on (RRAO).  \n(1) The capital requirement under the sensitivities-based method must be calculated by \naggregating three risk measures ‚Äì delta, vega and curvature, as set out in section 9.5.2: \n(a) Delta: a risk measure based on sensitivities of an instrument to regulatory delta \nrisk factors.  \n(b) Vega: a risk measure based on sensitivities to regulatory vega risk factors.  \n(c) Curvature: a risk measure which captures the incremental risk not captured by the \ndelta risk measure for price changes in an option. Curvature risk is based on two \nstress scenarios involving an upward shock and a downward shock to each \nregulatory risk factor.  \n(d) The above three risk measures specify risk weights to be applied to the regulatory \nrisk factor sensitivities. To calculate the overall capital requirement, the risk-\nweighted sensitivities are aggregated using specified correlation parameters to \nrecognize diversification benefits between risk factors. In order to address the risk \nthat correlations may increase or decrease in periods of financial stress, an \ninstitution must calculate three sensitivities-based method capital requirement \nvalues, based on three different scenarios on the specified values for the \ncorrelation parameters as set out in paragraphs 118 and 119.   \n(2) The DRC requirement captures the jump-to-default risk for instruments subject to credit \nrisk as set out in paragraph 215. It is calibrated based on the credit risk treatment in the \nbanking book in order to reduce the potential discrepancy in capital requirements for \nsimilar risk exposures across the institution. Some hedging recognition is allowed for \nsimilar types of exposures (corporates, sovereigns, and local \ngovernments/municipalities). \n(3) Given recognition that not all market risks can be captured in the standardized approach \nso as to avoid an unduly complex regime, an RRAO ensures sufficient coverage of \nmarket risks for instruments specified in paragraph 259. The calculation method for the \nRRAO is set out in paragraph 265. \n[Basel Framework, MAR20.4]",

Alternatively, the risk-free yield curve should be \nbased on one or more market-implied swap curves used by the institution to mark \npositions to market. For example, interbank offered rate (BOR) swap curves. \n(b) When data on market-implied swap curves described in above (1)(a) are \ninsufficient, the risk-free yield curve may be derived from the most appropriate \nsovereign bond curve for a given currency. In such cases the sensitivities related \nto sovereign bonds are not exempt from the CSR capital requirement: when an \ninstitution cannot perform the decomposition y=r+cs, any sensitivity to y is \nallocated both to the GIRR and to CSR classes as appropriate with the risk factor \nand sensitivity definitions in the standardized approach. Applying swap curves to \nbond-derived sensitivities for GIRR will not change the requirement for basis risk \nto be captured between bond and credit default swap (CDS) curves in the CSR \nclass. \n(c) For the purpose of constructing the risk-free yield curve per currency, an OIS \ncurve (such as Eonia or a new benchmark rate) and a BOR swap curve (such as \nthree-month Euribor or other benchmark rates) must be considered two different \ncurves. Two BOR curves at different maturities (e.g. three-month Euribor and six-\nmonth Euribor) must be considered two different curves. An onshore and an \noffshore currency curve (e.g. onshore Indian rupee and offshore Indian rupee) \nmust be considered two different curves.  \n(2) The GIRR delta risk factors also include a flat curve of market-implied inflation rates for \neach currency with term structure not recognized as a risk factor. \n(a) The sensitivity to the inflation rate from the exposure to implied coupons in an \ninflation instrument gives rise to a specific capital requirement. All inflation risks \nfor a currency must be aggregated to one number via simple sum. \n(b) This risk factor is only relevant for an instrument when a cash flow is functionally \ndependent on a measure of inflation (e.g. the notional amount or an interest \npayment depending on a consumer price index). GIRR risk factors other than for \ninflation risk will apply to such an instrument notwithstanding. \n(c) Inflation rate risk is considered in addition to the sensitivity to interest rates from \nthe same instrument, which must be allocated, according to the GIRR framework, \nin the term structure of the relevant risk-free yield curve in the same currency. \n \n20  The assignment of risk factors to the specified tenors should be performed by linear interpolation or a method \nthat is most consistent with the pricing functions used by the independent risk control function of an institution to \nreport market risks or P&L to senior management.",

As no maturity \ndimension is specified for the delta capital requirement for inflation (i.e. the \npossible underlying of the option), the vega risk for inflation should be considered \nonly along the single dimension of the maturity of the option. \n(3) The GIRR delta risk factors also include one of two possible cross-currency basis risk \nfactors\n21 for each currency (i.e. each GIRR bucket) with the term structure not recognized \nas a risk factor (i.e. both cross-currency basis curves are flat). \n(a) The two cross-currency basis risk factors are basis of each currency over USD or \nbasis of each currency over EUR. For instance, an AUD-denominated institution \ntrading a JPY/USD cross-currency basis swap would have a sensitivity to the \nJPY/USD basis but not to the JPY/EUR basis. \n(b) Cross-currency bases that do not relate to either basis over USD or basis over \nEUR must be computed either on ‚Äúbasis over USD‚Äù or ‚Äúbasis over EUR‚Äù but not \nboth. GIRR risk factors other than for cross-currency basis risk will apply to such \nan instrument notwithstanding. \n(c) Cross-currency basis risk is considered in addition to the sensitivity to interest \nrates from the same instrument, which must be allocated, according to the GIRR \nframework, in the term structure of the relevant risk-free yield curve in the same \ncurrency. \n(d) When calculating the cross-currency basis spread (CCBS) capital requirement, \ninstitutions may use a term structure-based CCBS curve and aggregate \nsensitivities to individual tenors by simple sum. \n(e) Cross-currency bases are included in the GIRR vega risk capital requirement. As \nno maturity dimension is specified for the delta capital requirement for cross-\ncurrency bases (i.e. the possible underlying of the option), the vega risk for cross-\ncurrency bases should be considered only along the single dimension of the \nmaturity of the option. \n(4) Vega GIRR: within each currency, the GIRR vega risk factors are the implied volatilities \nof options that reference GIRR-sensitive underlyings; as defined along two dimensions:\n22  \n(a) The maturity of the option: the implied volatility of the option as mapped to one \nor several of the following maturity tenors: 0.5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years and \n10 years. \n \n21  Cross-currency basis are basis added to a yield curve in order to evaluate a swap for which the two legs a re paid \nin two different currencies. They are in particular used by market participants to price cross -currency interest rate \nswaps paying a fixed or a floating leg in one currency, receiving a fixed or a floating leg in a second currency, \nand including an exchange of the notional in the two currencies at the start date and at the end date of the swap.  \n22  For example, an option with a forward starting cap, lasting 12 months, consists of four consecutive caplets on \nUSD three-month Libor. There are four (independent) options, with option expiry dates in 12, 15, 18 and 21 \nmonths. These options are all on underlying USD three-month Libor; the underlying always matures three \nmonths after the option expiry date (its residual maturity being three months). Therefore , the implied volatilities \nfor a regular forward starting cap, which would start in one year and last for 12 months should be defined along \nthe following two dimensions: (i) the maturity of the option‚Äôs individual components (caplets) ‚Äì  12, 15, 18 and \n21 months; and (ii) the residual maturity of the underlying of the option ‚Äì three months.",

Commodity delta risk factors are defined along two dimensions: \n(a) legal terms with respect to the delivery location\n23 of the commodity; and \n(b) time to maturity of the traded instrument at the following tenors: 0 years, 0.25 \nyears, 0.5 years, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years and \n30 years. \nThe current prices for futures and forward contracts should be used to compute the \ncommodity delta risk factors. Commodity delta should be allocated to the relevant tenor \nbased on the tenor of the futures and forward contract and given that spot commodity \nprice positions should be slotted into the first tenor (0 years). \n(2) Vega commodity: the commodity vega risk factors are the implied volatilities of options \nthat reference commodity spot prices as underlyings. No differentiation between \ncommodity spot prices by the maturity of the underlying or delivery location is required. \nThe commodity vega risk factors are further defined along one dimension, the maturity of \nthe option. This is defined as the implied volatility of the option as mapped to one or \nseveral of the following maturity tenors: 0.5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years and 10 years. \n(3) Curvature commodity: the commodity curvature risk factors are defined along only one \ndimension, the constructed curve (i.e. no term structure decomposition) per commodity \nspot prices. For the calculation of sensitivities, all tenors (as defined for delta commodity) \nare to be shifted in parallel.  \n(4) For precious metals capital calculations, institutions have the option to decompose future \nand forward contracts into spot and lease rate exposures subject to pricing availability. \nLease rates can be included as a GIRR risk factor according to paragraph 120. \n[Basel Framework, MAR21.13] \n126.

As a consequence, \ninstitutions may use a log-normal or normal assumption for GIRR and CSR (in recognition of the trade -offs \nbetween constrained specification and computational burden for a standardized approach). For the other risk \nclasses, institutions must only use a log-normal assumption (in recognition that this is aligned with common \npractices across jurisdictions).",

The gross JTD risk position is computed exposure by exposure. For instance, if an \ninstitution has a long position on a bond issued by Apple, and another short position on a bond \nissued by Apple, it must compute two separate JTD exposures. [Basel Framework, MAR22.9] \n222. For the purpose of DRC requirements, the determination of the long/short direction of \npositions must be on the basis of long or short with respect to whether the credit exposure results \nin a loss or gain in the case of a default. \n(1) Specifically, a long exposure is defined as a credit exposure that results in a loss in the \ncase of a default. \n(2) For derivative contracts, the long/short direction is also determined by whether the \ncontract will result in a loss in the case of a default (i.e. long or short position is not \ndetermined by whether the option or credit default swap (CDS), is bought or sold). Thus, \nfor the purpose of DRC requirements, a sold put option on a bond is a long credit \nexposure, since a default results in a loss to the seller of the option.  \n[Basel Framework, MAR22.10] \n223. The gross JTD is a function of the loss given default (LGD), notional amount (or face \nvalue) and the cumulative profit and loss (P&L) already realised on the position, where: \n(1) notional is the bond-equivalent notional amount (or face value) of the position; and \n(2) P&L is the cumulative mark-to-market loss (or gain) already taken on the exposure.

When the offsetting involves decomposing single name equivalent \nexposures, decomposition using a valuation model would be allowed in certain cases as \nfollows. Such decomposition is the sensitivity of the security‚Äôs value to the default of the \nunderlying single name obligor. Decomposition with a valuation model is defined as \nfollows: a single name equivalent constituent of a securitization (e.g. tranched position) is \nthe difference between the unconditional value of the securitization and the conditional \nvalue of the securitization assuming that the single name defaults, with zero recovery, \nwhere the value is determined by a valuation model. In such cases, the decomposition \ninto single-name equivalent exposures must account for the effect of marginal defaults of \nthe single names in the securitization, where in particular the sum of the decomposed \nsingle name amounts must be consistent with the undecomposed value of the \nsecuritization. Further, such decomposition is restricted to vanilla securitizations (e.g. \nvanilla CDOs, index tranches or bespokes); while the decomposition of exotic \nsecuritizations (e.g. CDO squared) is prohibited. \n(3) Moreover, for long and short positions in index tranches, and indices (non-tranched), if \nthe exposures are to the exact same series of the index, then offsetting is allowed by \nreplication and decomposition. For instance, a long securitization exposure in a 10‚Äì15% \ntranche vs combined short securitization exposures in 10‚Äì12% and 12‚Äì15% tranches on \nthe same index/series can be offset against each other. Similarly, long securitization \nexposures in the various tranches that, when combined perfectly, replicate a position in \nthe index series (non-tranched) can be offset against a short securitization exposure in the \nindex series if all the positions are to the exact same index and series (e.g. CDX.NA.IG \nseries 18). Long and short positions in indices and single-name constituents in the index \nmay also be offset by decomposition.

OSFI will only approve an institution‚Äôs use of internal models to determine market risk \ncapital requirements if, at a minimum: \n(1) OSFI is satisfied that the institution‚Äôs risk management system is conceptually sound and \nis implemented with integrity; \n(2) the institution has, in OSFI‚Äôs view, a sufficient number of staff skilled in the use of \nsophisticated models not only in the trading area but also in the risk control, audit and, if \nnecessary, back office areas; \n(3) the institution‚Äôs trading desk risk management model has, in OSFI‚Äôs judgement, a proven \ntrack record of reasonable accuracy in measuring risk; \n(4) the institution regularly conducts stress tests along the lines set out in paragraphs 284 to \n288; and \n(5) the positions included in the institution‚Äôs internal trading desk risk management models \nfor determining minimum market risk capital requirements are held in trading desks that \nhave been approved for the use of those models and that have passed the required tests \ndescribed in paragraph 282.  \nInstitutions applying to use internal models to determine market risk capital requirements are \nrequired to meet an internal models coverage threshold of 50% at all times. This coverage ratio is \ncalculated as the ratio of the standardized market risk capital requirements of internal model \napproved in-scope desks divided by the standardized market risk capital requirement of all desks \n(including out of scope desks but excluding those portfolios captured in paragraph 50). For \nclarity, only instruments for which the standardized approach must be used by all institutions, as \nspecified in paragraph 50, and their capital contribution should be excluded from the numerator \nand the denominator, along with their respective hedges.

Model \nvalidation must be conducted both when the model is initially developed and when any \nsignificant changes are made to the model.

This may include reviewing the appropriateness of \nassumptions of normal distributions and any pricing models. \n(2) Further to the regulatory backtesting programmes, model validation must assess the \nhypothetical P&L (HPL) calculation methodology. \n(3) The institution must use hypothetical portfolios to ensure that internal models are able to \naccount for particular structural features that may arise. For example, where the data \nhistory for a particular instrument does not meet the quantitative standards in paragraphs \n361 to 372 and the institution maps these positions to proxies, the institution must ensure \nthat the proxies produce conservative results under relevant market scenarios, with \nsufficient consideration given to ensuring: \n(a) that material basis risks are adequately reflected (including mismatches between \nlong and short positions by maturity or by issuer); and \n(b) that the models reflect concentration risk that may arise in an undiversified \nportfolio. \n[Basel Framework, MAR30.17] \n9.6.1.4  External Validation \n283.

For example, the institution may be required to provide \nOSFI with an assessment of how many days of peak day losses would have been covered \nby a given ES estimate. \n(2) Scenarios requiring a simulation by the institution. Institutions should subject their \nportfolios to a series of simulated stress scenarios and provide OSFI with the results. \nThese scenarios could include testing the current portfolio against past periods of \nsignificant disturbance (e.g. the 1987 equity crash, the Exchange Rate Mechanism crises \nof 1992 and 1993, the increase in interest rates in the first quarter of 1994, the 1998 \nRussian financial crisis, the 2000 bursting of the technology stock bubble, the 2007‚Äì08 \nsubprime mortgage crisis, or the 2011‚Äì12 Euro zone crisis) incorporating both the \nsignificant price movements and the sharp reduction in liquidity associated with these \nevents. A second type of scenario would evaluate the sensitivity of the institution‚Äôs \nmarket risk exposure to changes in the assumptions about volatilities and correlations. \nApplying this test would require an evaluation of the historical range of variation for \nvolatilities and correlations and evaluation of the institution‚Äôs current positions against \nthe extreme values of the historical range. Due consideration should be given to the sharp \nvariation that at times has occurred in a matter of days in periods of significant market \ndisturbance. For example, the above-mentioned situations involved correlations within \nrisk factors approaching the extreme values of 1 or ‚Äì1 for several days at the height of the \ndisturbance. \n(3) Institution-developed stress scenarios. In addition to the scenarios prescribed by OSFI \nunder paragraph 288(1), an institution should also develop its own stress tests that it \nidentifies as most adverse based on the characteristics of its portfolio (e.g. problems in a \nkey region of the world combined with a sharp move in oil prices).

Under this approach, the institution must define the \nbuckets it will use and meet the following requirements: \n(a) Each bucket must include only one risk factor, and all risk factors must \ncorrespond to the risk factors that are part of the risk-theoretical profit and loss \n(RTPL) of the institution for the purpose of the profit and loss (P&L) attribution \n(PLA) test.\n54  \n(b) The buckets must be non-overlapping. \n(2) The regulatory bucketing approach. Under this approach, the institution must use the \nfollowing set of standard buckets as set out in Table 16.  \n(a) For interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity risk factors with one maturity \ndimension (excluding implied volatilities) (t, where t is measured in years), the \nbuckets in row (A) below must be used. \n(b) For interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity risk factors with several \nmaturity dimensions (excluding implied volatilities) (t, where t is measured in \nyears), the buckets in row (B) below must be used. \n(c) Credit spread and equity risk factors with one or several maturity dimensions \n(excluding implied volatilities) (t, where t is measured in years), the buckets in \nrow (C) below must be used. \n \n53  In this case, the institution may be permitted to use real price observations from this vendor for other risk factors.  \n54  The requirement to use the same buckets or segmentation of risk factors for the PLA test and the RFET \nrecognises that there is a trade-off in determining buckets for an ES model. The use of more granular buckets \nmay facilitate a trading desk‚Äôs success in meeting the requirements of the PLA test, but additional granularity \nmay challenge an institution‚Äôs ability to source a sufficient number of real observed prices per bucket to satisfy \nthe RFET.

[Basel Framework, MAR31.23] \n313. There may, on very rare occasions, be a valid reason why a significant number of \nmodellable risk factors across different institutions may become non-modellable due to a \nwidespread reduction in trading activities (for instance, during periods of significant cross-border \nfinancial market stress affecting several institutions or when financial markets are subjected to a \nmajor regime shift). One possible OSFI‚Äôs response in this instance could be to consider as \nmodellable a risk factor that no longer passes the RFET.

In addition to the requirements specified in paragraphs 301 to 312, institutions must apply \nthe principles below to determine whether a risk factor that passed the RFET can be modelled \nusing the ES model or should be subject to capital requirements as an NMRF. Institutions are \nrequired to demonstrate to OSFI that these principles are being followed. OSFI may determine \nrisk factors to be non-modellable in the event these principles are not applied. \n(1) Principle one. The data used may include combinations of modellable risk factors. \nInstitutions often price instruments as a combination of risk factors. Generally, risk \nfactors derived solely from a combination of modellable risk factors are modellable. For \nexample, risk factors derived through multifactor beta models for which inputs and \ncalibrations are based solely on modellable risk factors, can be classified as modellable \nand can be included within the ES model. A risk factor derived from a combination of \nmodellable risk factors that are mapped to distinct buckets of a given curve/surface is \nmodellable only if this risk factor also passes the RFET. \n(a) Interpolation based on combinations of modellable risk factors should be \nconsistent with mappings used for PLA testing (to determine the RTPL) and \nshould not be based on alternative, and potentially broader, bucketing approaches. \nLikewise, institutions may compress risk factors into a smaller dimension of \northogonal risk factors (e.g. principal components) and/or derive parameters from \nobservations of modellable risk factors, such as in models of stochastic implied \nvolatility, without the parameters being directly observable in the market.  \n(b) Subject to the approval of OSFI, institutions may extrapolate up to a reasonable \ndistance from the closest modellable risk factor. The extrapolation should not rely \nsolely on the closest modellable risk factor but on more than one modellable risk \nfactor. In the event that an institution uses extrapolation, the extrapolation must be \nconsidered in the determination of the RTPL. \n(2) Principle two. The data used must allow the model to pick up both idiosyncratic and \ngeneral market risk. General market risk is the tendency of an instrument‚Äôs value to \nchange with the change in the value of the broader market, as represented by an \nappropriate index or indices. Idiosyncratic risk is the risk associated with a particular \nissuance, including default provisions, maturity and seniority. The data must allow both \ncomponents of market risk to be captured in any market risk model used to determine \ncapital requirements. If the data used in the model do not reflect either idiosyncratic or \ngeneral market risk, the institution must apply an NMRF charge for those aspects that are \nnot adequately captured in its model. \n(3) Principle three. The data used must allow the model to reflect volatility and correlation \nof the risk positions. Institutions must ensure that they do not understate the volatility of \nan asset (e.g. by using inappropriate averaging of data or proxies). Further, institutions \nmust ensure that they accurately reflect the correlation of asset prices, rates across yield \ncurves and/or volatilities within volatility surfaces. Different data sources can provide \ndramatically different volatility and correlation estimates for asset prices. The institution \nshould choose data sources so as to ensure that (i) the data are representative of real price \nobservations; (ii) price volatility is not understated by the choice of data; and \n(iii) correlations are reasonable approximations of correlations among real price \nobservations. Furthermore, any transformations must not understate the volatility arising",

The data used must be reflective of prices observed and/or quoted in the \nmarket. Where data used are not derived from real price observations, the institution must \ndemonstrate that the data used are reasonably representative of real price observations. \nTo that end, the institution must periodically reconcile price data used in a risk model \nwith front office and back office prices. Just as the back office serves to check the \nvalidity of the front office price, risk model prices should be included in the comparison. \nThe comparison of front or back office prices with risk prices should consist of \ncomparisons of risk prices with real price observations, but front office and back office \nprices can be used where real price observations are not widely available. Institutions \nmust document their approaches to deriving risk factors from market prices. \n(5) Principle five. The data used must be updated at a sufficient frequency. A market risk \nmodel may require large amounts of data, and it can be challenging to update such large \ndata sets frequently. Institutions should strive to update their model data as often as \npossible to account for frequent turnover of positions in the trading portfolio and \nchanging market conditions. Institutions should update data at a minimum on a monthly \nbasis, but preferably daily. Additionally, institutions should have a workflow process for \nupdating the sources of data. Furthermore, where the institution uses regressions to \nestimate risk factor parameters, these must be re-estimated on a regular basis, generally \nno less frequently than every two weeks. Calibration of pricing models to current market \nprices must also be sufficiently frequent, ideally no less frequent than the calibration of \nfront office pricing models. Where appropriate, institutions should have clear policies for \nbackfilling and/or gap-filling missing data. \n(6) Principle six. The data used to determine stressed expected shortfall (ES\nR,S) must be \nreflective of market prices observed and/or quoted in the period of stress. The data for the \nES\nR,S model should be sourced directly from the historical period whenever possible. \nThere are cases where the characteristics of current instruments in the market differ from \nthose in the stress period. Nevertheless, institutions must empirically justify any instances \nwhere the market prices used for the stress period are different from the market prices \nactually observed during that period. Further, in cases where instruments that are \ncurrently traded did not exist during a period of significant financial stress, institutions \nmust demonstrate that the prices used match changes in prices or spreads of similar \ninstruments during the stress period. \n(a) In cases where institutions do not sufficiently justify the use of current market \ndata for products whose characteristics have changed since the stress period, the \ninstitution must omit the risk factor for the stressed period and meet the \nrequirement of paragraph 365(2)(b) that the reduced set of risk factors explain \n75% of the fully specified ES model. Moreover, if name-specific risk factors are \nused to calculate the ES in the actual period and these names were not available in \nthe stressed period, there is a presumption that the idiosyncratic part of these risk \nfactors are not in the reduced set of risk factors. Exposures for risk factors that are \nincluded in the current set but not in the reduced set need to be mapped to the \nmost suitable risk factor of the reduced set for the purposes of calculating ES \nmeasures in the stressed period.",

As set out in paragraph 269, an institution that intends to use the internal models \napproach (IMA) to determine market risk capital requirements for a trading desk must conduct \nand successfully pass backtesting at the institution-wide level and both the backtesting and profit \nand loss (P&L) attribution (PLA) test at the trading desk level as identified in paragraph 269(2). \n[Basel Framework, MAR32.1] \n317. Paragraph 267 describes the criteria that an institution must meet in order to remain \neligible to use the IMA to determine market risk capital requirements. The institution‚Äôs \naggregated market risk capital requirement must be based on positions held in trading desks that \nqualify for use of the institution‚Äôs internal models for market risk capital requirements by \nsatisfying the backtesting and PLA test as set out in this section. This criterion must be assessed \nby the institution on a quarterly basis when calculating the aggregate capital requirement for \nmarket risk according to paragraph 403. [Basel Framework, MAR32.2]  \n318. The implementation of the backtesting programme and the PLA test must begin on the \ndate that the internal models capital requirement becomes effective.",

In these cases, an \ninstitution must document the history of the movement of the value of the relevant non-\nmodellable risk factor and have supporting evidence that the non-modellable risk factor has \ncaused the relevant loss. \nIf the backtesting exception at a desk-level test is being driven by a non-modellable risk factor \nthat receives an SES capital requirement that is in excess of the maximum of the APL loss or \nHPL loss for that day, it is permitted to be disregarded for the purposes of the desk-level \nbacktesting.

These adjustments can be done \neither: \n(1) by direct replacement of the RTPL input data (e.g. par rate tenor x, provider a) with the \nHPL input data (e.g. par rate tenor x, provider b); or \n(2) by using the HPL input data (e.g. par rate tenor x, provider b) as a basis to calculate the \nrisk factor data needed in the RTPL/ES model (e.g. zero rate tenor x). \nIn the event trading desks of an institution operate in different time zones compared to the \nlocation of the institution‚Äôs risk control department, the institution is permitted to align the \nsnapshot time used for the calculation of the RTPL of a desk to the snapshot time used for the \nderivation of its HPL. [Basel Framework, MAR32.31] \n347. If the HPL uses market data in a different manner to RTPL to calculate risk parameters \nthat are essential to the valuation engine, these differences must be reflected in the PLA test and \nas a result in the calculation of HPL and RTPL. In this regard, HPL and RTPL are allowed to use \nthe same market data only as a basis, but must use their respective methods (which can differ) to \ncalculate the respective valuation engine parameters. This would be the case, for example, where \nmarket data are transformed as part of the valuation process used to calculate RTPL. In that \ninstance, institutions may align market data between RTPL and HPL pre-transformation but not \npost-transformation. [Basel Framework, MAR32.32] \n348. Institutions are not permitted to align HPL input data for risk factors with input data used \nin RTPL. Adjustments to RTPL or HPL to address residual operational noise are not permitted. \nResidual operational noise arises from computing HPL and RTPL in two different systems at two \ndifferent points in time.

The random variable that determines whether an \nobligor defaults must be an obligor-specific function of the systematic factors of both \ntypes and of an idiosyncratic factor.

[Basel Framework, \nMAR33.46] \n9.6.5 GUIDANCE ON USE OF THE INTERNAL MODELS APPROACH \nThis section sets out application guidance for backtesting requirements and principles for risk \nfactor modellability under the internal models approach. \n9.6.5.1  Trading Desk-Level Backtesting \n407. An additional consideration in specifying the appropriate risk measures and trading \noutcomes for profit and loss (P&L) attribution test and backtesting arises because the internally \nmodelled risk measurement is generally based on the sensitivity of a static portfolio to \ninstantaneous price shocks. That is, end-of-day trading positions are input into the risk \nmeasurement model, which assesses the possible change in the value of this static portfolio due \nto price and rate movements over the assumed holding period. [Basel Framework, MAR99.1] \n408. While this is straightforward in theory, in practice it complicates the issue of backtesting. \nFor instance, it is often argued that neither expected shortfall nor value-at-risk measures can be \ncompared against actual trading outcomes, since the actual outcomes will reflect changes in \nportfolio composition during the holding period. According to this view, the inclusion of fee \nincome together with trading gains and losses resulting from changes in the composition of the \nportfolio should not be included in the definition of the trading outcome because they do not \nrelate to the risk inherent in the static portfolio that was assumed in constructing the value-at-risk \nmeasure. [Basel Framework, MAR99.2] \n409. This argument is persuasive with regard to the use of risk measures based on price shocks \ncalibrated to longer holding periods. That is, comparing the liquidity-adjusted time horizon 99\nth \npercentile risk measures from the internal models capital requirement with actual liquidity-\nadjusted time horizon trading outcomes would probably not be a meaningful exercise. In \nparticular, in any given multi-day period, significant changes in portfolio composition relative to \nthe initial positions are common at major trading institutions. For this reason, the backtesting \nframework described here involves the use of risk measures calibrated to a one-day holding \nperiod. Other than the restrictions mentioned in this paper, the test would be based on how \ninstitutions model risk internally. [Basel Framework, MAR99.3] \n410. Given the use of one-day risk measures, it is appropriate to employ one-day trading \noutcomes as the benchmark to use in the backtesting programme. The same concerns about \n‚Äúcontamination‚Äù of the trading outcomes discussed above continue to be relevant, however, even \nfor one-day trading outcomes. That is, there is a concern that the overall one-day trading",

[Basel \nFramework, MAR99.4] \n411. On the one hand, intraday trading will tend to increase the volatility of trading outcomes \nand may result in cases where the overall trading outcome exceeds the risk measure. This event \nclearly does not imply a problem with the methods used to calculate the risk measure; rather, it is \nsimply outside the scope of what the measure is intended to capture. On the other hand, including \nfee income may similarly distort the backtest, but in the other direction, since fee income often \nhas annuity-like characteristics. Since this fee income is not typically included in the calculation \nof the risk measure, problems with the risk measurement model could be masked by including \nfee income in the definition of the trading outcome used for backtesting purposes. [Basel \nFramework, MAR99.5] \n412. To the extent that backtesting programmes are viewed purely as a statistical test of the \nintegrity of the calculation of the risk measures, it is appropriate to employ a definition of daily \ntrading outcome that allows for an uncontaminated test. To meet this standard, institutions must \nhave the capability to perform the tests based on the hypothetical changes in portfolio value that \nwould occur were end-of-day positions to remain unchanged. [Basel Framework, MAR99.6] \n413. Backtesting using actual daily P&Ls is also a useful exercise since it can uncover cases \nwhere the risk measures are not accurately capturing trading volatility in spite of being calculated \nwith integrity. [Basel Framework, MAR99.7] \n414. For these reasons, OSFI requires institutions to develop the capability to perform these \ntests using both hypothetical and actual trading outcomes. In combination, the two approaches \nare likely to provide a strong understanding of the relation between calculated risk measures and \ntrading outcomes. The total number of backtesting exceptions for the purpose of the thresholds in \nparagraph 324 must be calculated as the maximum of the exceptions generated under \nhypothetical or actual trading outcomes. [Basel Framework, MAR99.8] \n9.6.5.2  Institution-Wide Backtesting \nStatistical considerations in defining the backtesting zones \n415. To place the definitions of three zones of the institution-wide backtesting in proper \nperspective, however, it is useful to examine the probabilities of obtaining various numbers of \nexceptions under different assumptions about the accuracy of an institution‚Äôs risk measurement \nmodel. [Basel Framework, MAR99.9] \n416. Three zones have been delineated and their boundaries chosen in order to balance two \ntypes of statistical error:  \n(1) the possibility that an accurate risk model would be classified as inaccurate on the basis \nof its backtesting result, and  \n(2) the possibility that an inaccurate model would not be classified that way based on its \nbacktesting result.",

For example, if the \nthreshold is set as low as one exception, then accurate models will be rejected fully 91.9% of the \ntime, because they will escape rejection only in the 8.1% of cases where they generate zero \nexceptions. As the threshold number of exceptions is increased, the probability of making this \ntype of error declines. [Basel Framework, MAR99.13] \n420. Under the assumptions that the model‚Äôs true level of coverage is not 99%, the table \nreports the probability that selecting a given number of exceptions as a threshold for rejecting the \naccuracy of the model will result in an erroneous acceptance of a model with the assumed \n(inaccurate) level of coverage (type 2 error). For example, if the model‚Äôs actual level of coverage \nis 97%, and the threshold for rejection is set at seven or more exceptions, the table indicates that \nthis model would be erroneously accepted 37.5% of the time. [Basel Framework, MAR99.14] \n421. The results in Table 21 also demonstrate some of the statistical limitations of backtesting. \nIn particular, there is no threshold number of exceptions that yields both a low probability of \nerroneously rejecting an accurate model and a low probability of erroneously accepting all of the \nrelevant inaccurate models. It is for this reason that OSFI has rejected an approach that contains \nonly a single threshold. [Basel Framework, MAR99.15] \n422. Given these limitations, OSFI has classified outcomes for the backtesting of the \ninstitution-wide model into three categories. In the first category, the test results are consistent \nwith an accurate model, and the possibility of erroneously accepting an inaccurate model is low \n(i.e. backtesting ‚Äúgreen zone‚Äù). At the other extreme, the test results are extremely unlikely to \nhave resulted from an accurate model, and the probability of erroneously rejecting an accurate \nmodel on this basis is remote (i.e. backtesting ‚Äúred zone‚Äù). In between these two cases, however, \nis a zone where the backtesting results could be consistent with either accurate or inaccurate \nmodels, and OSFI will encourage an institution to present additional information about its model \nbefore taking action (i.e. backtesting ‚Äùamber zone‚Äù). [Basel Framework, MAR99.16] \n423. Table 22 sets out the OSFI‚Äôs agreed boundaries for these zones and the presumptive OSFI \nresponse for each backtesting outcome, based on a sample of 250 observations. For other sample \nsizes, the boundaries should be deduced by calculating the binomial probabilities associated with \ntrue coverage of 99%, as in Table 21. The backtesting amber zone begins at the point such that \nthe probability of obtaining that number or fewer exceptions equals or exceeds 95%. Table 22 \nreports these cumulative probabilities for each number of exceptions. For 250 observations, it \ncan be seen that five or fewer exceptions will be obtained 95.88% of the time when the true level \nof coverage is 99%. Thus, the backtesting amber zone begins at five exceptions. Similarly, the \nbeginning of the backtesting red zone is defined as the point such that the probability of \nobtaining that number or fewer exceptions equals or exceeds 99.99%. Table 22 shows that for a \nsample of 250 observations and a true coverage level of 99%, this occurs with 10 exceptions.",

Since a model that truly provides \n99% coverage would be quite likely to produce as many as four exceptions in a sample of 250 \noutcomes, there is little reason for concern raised by backtesting results that fall in this range. \nThis is reinforced by the results in Table 21, which indicate that accepting outcomes in this range \nleads to only a small chance of erroneously accepting an inaccurate model. [Basel Framework, \nMAR99.18] \n425. The range from five to nine exceptions constitutes the backtesting amber zone. Outcomes \nin this range are plausible for both accurate and inaccurate models, although Table 21 suggests \nthat they are generally more likely for inaccurate models than for accurate models. Moreover, the \nresults in Table 21 indicate that the presumption that the model is inaccurate should grow as the \nnumber of exceptions increases in the range from five to nine.

Table 22 sets out the OSFI‚Äôs agreed guidelines for increases in the multiplication factor \napplicable to the internal models capital requirement, resulting from backtesting results in the \nbacktesting amber zone. [Basel Framework, MAR99.20] \n427. These particular values reflect the general idea that the increase in the multiplication \nfactor should be sufficient to return the model to a 99th percentile standard. For example, five \nexceptions in a sample of 250 imply only 98% coverage. Thus, the increase in the multiplication \nfactor should be sufficient to transform a model with 98% coverage into one with 99% coverage. \nNeedless to say, precise calculations of this sort require additional statistical assumptions that are \nnot likely to hold in all cases. For example, if the distribution of trading outcomes is assumed to \nbe normal, then the ratio of the 99th percentile to the 98th percentile is approximately 1.14, and \nthe increase needed in the multiplication factor is therefore approximately 1.13 for a multiplier of \n1. If the actual distribution is not normal, but instead has ‚Äúfat tails‚Äù, then larger increases may be \nrequired to reach the 99\nth percentile standard. The concern about fat tails was also an important \nfactor in the choice of the specific increments set out in Table 22. [Basel Framework, \nMAR99.21] \n9.6.5.3  Examples of the Application of the Principles for Risk Factor Modellability \n428. Although OSFI may use discretion regarding the types of evidence required of \ninstitutions to provide risk factor modellability, the following are examples of the types of \nevidence that institutions may be required to provide. \n(1) Regression diagnostics for multi-factor beta models. In addition to showing that indices or \nother regressors are appropriate for the region, asset class and credit quality (if \napplicable) of an instrument, institutions must be prepared to demonstrate that the \ncoefficients used in multi-factor models are adequate to capture both general market risk \nand idiosyncratic risk. If the institution assumes that the residuals from the multi-factor \nmodel are uncorrelated with each other, the institution should be prepared to demonstrate \nthat the modellable residuals are uncorrelated. Further, the factors in the multi-factor \nmodel must be appropriate for the region and asset class of the instrument and must \nexplain the general market risk of the instrument. This must be demonstrated through \ngoodness-of-fit statistics (e.g. an adjusted-R2 coefficient) and other diagnostics on the \ncoefficients. Most importantly, where the estimated coefficients are not used (i.e. the \nparameters are judgment-based), the institution must describe how the coefficients are \nchosen and why they cannot be estimated, and demonstrate that the choice does not \nunderestimate risk. In general, risk factors are not considered modellable in cases where \nparameters are set by judgment. \n(2) Recovery of price from risk factors. The institution must periodically demonstrate and \ndocument that the risk factors used in its risk model can be fed into front office pricing \nmodels and recover the actual prices of the assets. If the recovered prices substantially \ndeviate from the actual prices, this can indicate a problem with prices used to derive the \nrisk factors and call into question the validity of data inputs for risk purposes. In such \ncases, OSFI may determine that the risk factor is non-modellable. \n(3) Risk pricing is periodically reconciled with front office and back office prices.

Results of these reconciliations should be made available to OSFI, including \nstatistics on the differences of the risk price from front office and back office prices. It is \nstandard practice for institutions to conduct reconciliation of front office and back office \nprices; the risk prices must be included as part of the reconciliation of the front office and \nwhenever there is a potential for discrepancy. If the discrepancy is large, OSFI may \ndetermine that the risk factor is non-modellable. \n(4) Risk factors generated from parameterised models.

This section defines terms that will be used throughout this chapter. \n \n7.1.1.1 General terms \n \n‚Ä¢ Counterparty Credit Risk (CCR) is the risk that the counterparty to a transaction could \ndefault before the final settlement of the transaction's cash flows. An economic loss \nwould occur if the transactions or portfolio of transactions with the counterparty has a \npositive economic value at the time of default. Unlike an institution‚Äôs exposure to credit \nrisk through a loan, where the exposure to credit risk is unilateral and only the lending \ninstitution faces the risk of loss, CCR creates a bilateral risk of loss: the market value of \nthe transaction can be positive or negative to either counterparty to the transaction. The \nmarket value is uncertain and can vary over time with the movement of underlying \nmarket factors. \n‚Ä¢ A central counterparty (CCP) is a clearing house that interposes itself between \ncounterparties to contracts traded in one or more financial markets, becoming the buyer \nto every seller and the seller to every buyer and thereby ensuring the future performance \nof open contracts. A CCP becomes a counterparty to trades with market participants \nthrough novation, an open offer system, or another legally binding arrangement. For the \npurposes of the capital framework, a CCP is a financial institution.   \n‚Ä¢ A qualifying central counterparty (QCCP) is an entity that is licensed to operate as a \nCCP (including a license granted by way of confirming an exemption), and is permitted \nby the appropriate regulator/overseer to operate as such with respect to the products \n \n1    The Basel Framework  \n2  Following the format: [Basel Framework XXX yy.zz]. \n3 In this document, the terms ‚Äúexposure at default‚Äù and ‚Äúexposure amount‚Äù are used together in order to identify \nmeasures of exposure under both an internal ratings-based (IRB) and a standardized approach for credit risk.",

Margin lending \ntransactions do not include other loans that happen to be secured by securities collateral. \nGenerally, in margin lending transactions, the loan amount is collateralized by securities \nwhose value is greater than the amount of the loan. \n[Basel Framework, CRE 50.14] \n \n7.1.1.3 Netting sets, hedging sets, and related terms \n \n‚Ä¢ Netting Set is a group of transactions with a single counterparty that are subject to a \nlegally enforceable bilateral netting arrangement and for which netting is recognized for \nregulatory capital purposes under Chapter 4 or the Cross-Product Netting Rules set forth \nin this chapter. Each transaction that is not subject to a legally enforceable bilateral \nnetting arrangement that is recognized for regulatory capital purposes should be \ninterpreted as its own netting set for the purpose of these rules. \n‚Ä¢ Hedging Set is a set of transactions within a single netting set within which full or partial \noffsetting is recognized for purposes of calculating the potential future exposure (PFE) \nadd-on of the SA-CCR. .",

Current exposure is often also called Replacement Cost.  \n‚Ä¢ Peak Exposure is a high percentile (typically 95% or 99%) of the distribution of \nexposures at any particular future date before the maturity date of the longest transaction \nin the netting set. A peak exposure value is typically generated for many future dates up \nuntil the longest maturity date of transactions in the netting set. \n‚Ä¢ Expected Exposure is the mean (average) of the distribution of exposures at any \nparticular future date before the longest-maturity transaction in the netting set matures. \nAn expected exposure value is typically generated for many future dates up until the \nlongest maturity date of transactions in the netting set. \n‚Ä¢ Effective Expected Exposure at a specific date is the maximum expected exposure that \noccurs at that date or any prior date. Alternatively, it may be defined for a specific date as \nthe greater of the expected exposure at that date, or the effective exposure at the previous \ndate. In effect, the Effective Expected Exposure is the Expected Exposure that is \nconstrained to be non-decreasing over time. \n‚Ä¢ Expected Positive Exposure (EPE) is the weighted average over time of expected \nexposures where the weights are the proportion that an individual expected exposure \nrepresents of the entire time interval. When calculating the minimum capital requirement, \nthe average is taken over the first year or, if all the contracts in the netting set mature \nbefore one year, over the time period of the longest-maturity contract in the netting set.  \n‚Ä¢ Effective Expected Positive Exposure (Effective EPE) is the weighted average over \ntime of effective expected exposure over the first year, or, if all the contracts in the \nnetting set mature before one year, over the time period of the longest-maturity contract \nin the netting set where the weights are the proportion that an individual expected \nexposure represents of the entire time interval.  \n‚Ä¢ Credit Valuation Adjustment is an adjustment to the mid-market valuation of the \nportfolio of trades with a counterparty. This adjustment reflects the market value of the \ncredit risk due to any failure to perform on contractual agreements with a counterparty. \nThis adjustment may reflect the market value of the credit risk of the counterparty or the \nmarket value of the credit risk of both the institution and the counterparty.  \n‚Ä¢ One-Sided Credit Valuation Adjustment is a credit valuation adjustment that reflects \nthe market value of the credit risk of the counterparty to the firm, but does not reflect the \nmarket value of the credit risk of the institution to the counterparty. \n‚Ä¢ Debit Valuation Adjustment is a valuation adjustment that reflects the market value of \nthe credit risk of the institution to the counterparty (i.e. changes in the reporting \ninstitution‚Äôs own credit risk), but does not reflect the market value of the credit risk of the \ncounterparty to the institution.

This method is to be used for exposures arising from OTC \nderivatives, exchange-traded derivatives and long settlement transactions. This method must be \nused if the bank does not have approval to use the internal model method (IMM).  \n(2) The simple approach or comprehensive approach to the recognition of collateral, which are \nboth set out in the credit risk mitigation section of the standardized approach to credit risk (see \nChapter 4, section 4.3).

If the netting set is subject to a margin agreement and the internal model captures the \neffects of margining when estimating EE, the model‚Äôs EE measure may be used directly in \nequation (2).

An EPE model must also include transaction-specific information in order to capture the \neffects of margining. It must take into account both the current amount of margin and margin \nthat would be passed between counterparties in the future. Such a model must account for the \nnature of margin agreements (unilateral or bilateral), the frequency of margin calls, the margin \nperiod of risk, the thresholds of unmargined exposure the institution is willing to accept, and the \nminimum transfer amount. Such a model must either model the mark-to-market change in the \nvalue of collateral posted or apply this guideline‚Äôs rules for collateral.  [Basel Framework, CRE \n53.23] \n \n40.

Institutions must identify exposures that give rise to a greater degree of general wrong-\nway risk. Stress testing and scenario analyses must be designed to identify risk factors that are \npositively correlated with counterparty credit worthiness. Such testing needs to address the \npossibility of severe shocks occurring when relationships between risk factors have changed. \nInstitutions should monitor general wrong way risk by product, by region, by industry, or by \nother categories that are germane to the business. Reports should be provided to senior \nmanagement on a regular basis that communicate wrong way risks and the steps that are being \ntaken to manage that risk.  [Basel Framework, CRE 53.47] \n \n65. An institution is exposed to ‚Äúspecific wrong-way risk‚Äù (SWWR) if future exposure to a \nspecific counterparty is highly correlated with the counterparty‚Äôs probability of default. For \nexample, a company writing put options on its own stock creates wrong-way exposures for the \nbuyer that is specific to the counterparty. An institution must have procedures in place to \nidentify, monitor and control cases of SWWR, beginning at the inception of a trade and \ncontinuing through the life of the trade. To calculate the CCR capital charge, the instruments for \nwhich there exists a legal connection between the counterparty and the underlying issuer, and for \nwhich specific wrong way risk has been identified, are not considered to be in the same netting \nset as other transactions with the counterparty. Furthermore, for single-name credit default swaps \nwhere there exists a legal connection between the counterparty and the underlying issuer, and \nwhere SWWR has been identified, EAD in respect of such swap counterparty exposure equals \nthe full expected loss in the remaining fair value of the underlying instruments assuming the \nunderlying issuer is in liquidation. The use of the full expected loss in remaining fair value of the \nunderlying instrument allows the institution to recognize, in respect of such swap, the market \nvalue that has been lost already and any expected recoveries. Accordingly LGD for Advanced or \nFoundation IRB institutions must be set to 100% for such swap transactions.\n14 For institutions \nusing the standardized approach for credit risk, the risk weight to use is that of an unsecured \ntransaction. For equity derivatives, bond options, securities financing transactions etc. \nreferencing a single company where there exists a legal connection between the counterparty and \nthe underlying company, and where SWWR has been identified, EAD equals the value of the \ntransaction under the assumption of a jump-to-default of the underlying security. Inasmuch this \nmakes re-use of possibly existing (market risk) calculations (for IRC) that already contain an \nLGD assumption, the LGD must be set to 100%. LGD for Advanced and Foundation IRB banks \nwill be that of an unsecured exposure. For institutions using the standardized approach for credit \nrisk, the risk weight of an unsecured transaction should be used. \n \nThe counterparty credit risk arising from trades where SWWR has been identified can be \nmitigated through either prepayment or the collection of independent collateral amounts. If a \ncounterparty prepays the notional amount of the exposure for a trade where SWWR has been \n \n14  Note that the recoveries may also be possible on the underlying instrument beneath such swap.

An example of such an instance would be Specific Wrong Way Risk (WWR) transac tions which are \nrequired to each be moved to their own standalone netting set.   \n21  The netting contract must not contain any clause which, in the event of default of a counterparty, permits a non-\ndefaulting counterparty to make limited payments only, or no payments at all, to the estate of the defaulting \nparty, even if the defaulting party is a net creditor.",

Where a margin agreement exists, the \nformulation could apply both to bilateral transactions and central clearing relationships.

[Basel Framework, CRE 52.9] \n \nA. Formulation for unmargined transactions \n \n105. For unmargined transactions (that is, where VM is not exchanged, but collateral other \nthan VM may be present), RC is defined as the greater of: (i) the current market value of the \nderivative contracts less net haircut collateral held by the institution (if any), and (ii) zero.

Mathematically:   \n \nRC = max{V-C,0} \nwhere V is the value of the derivative transactions in the netting set and C is the haircut value of \nnet collateral held, which is calculated in accordance with the NICA methodology defined in \nparagraph 112. For this purpose, the value of non-cash collateral posted by the institution to its \ncounterparty is increased and the value of the non-cash collateral received by the institution from \nits counterparty is decreased using haircuts (which are the same as those that apply to repo-style \ntransactions) for the time periods described in paragraph 100.  \n[Basel Framework, CRE 52.10 and 52.11] \n \n106. In the above formulation, it is assumed that the replacement cost representing today‚Äôs \nexposure to the counterparty cannot go less than zero. However, institutions sometimes hold \nexcess collateral (even in the absence of a margin agreement) or have out-of-the-money trades \nwhich can further protect the institution from the increase of the exposure.

The RC for margined transactions in the SA-CCR is defined as the greatest exposure \nthat would not trigger a call for VM, taking into account the mechanics of collateral exchanges in \nmargining agreements. Such mechanics include, for example, ‚ÄúThreshold‚Äù, ‚ÄúMinimum Transfer \nAmount‚Äù and ‚ÄúIndependent Amount‚Äù in the standard industry documentation,\n23 which are \nfactored into a call for VM.24 [Basel Framework, CRE 52.14] \n \nC.

NICA does not include collateral that an institution has posted to a segregated, \nbankruptcy remote account, which presumably would be returned upon the bankruptcy of the \ncounterparty. That is, NICA represents any collateral (segregated or unsegregated) posted by the \ncounterparty less the unsegregated collateral posted by the institution. With respect to IA, NICA \ntakes into account the differential of IA required for the institution minus IA required for the \ncounterparty. [Basel Framework, CRE 52.17] \n \n113. For margined trades, the replacement cost is:  \nRC = max{V ‚Äì C; TH + MTA ‚Äì NICA;0} \nWhere: V and C are defined as in the unmargined formulation, except that C now includes the \nnet variation margin amount, where the amount received by the institution is accounted with a \npositive sign and the amount posted by the institution is accounted with a negative sign, TH is \nthe positive threshold before the counterparty must send the institution collateral, and MTA is \nthe minimum transfer amount applicable to the counterparty. [Basel Framework, CRE 52.18] \n \n114. TH + MTA ‚Äì NICA represents the largest exposure that would not trigger a VM call and \nit contains levels of collateral that need always to be maintained. For example, without initial \nmargin or IA, the greatest exposure that would not trigger a variation margin call is the threshold \nplus any minimum transfer amount. In the adapted formulation, NICA is subtracted from TH + \nMTA. This makes the calculation more accurate by fully reflecting both the actual level of \nexposure that would not trigger a margin call and the effect of collateral held and/or posted by an \ninstitution.

The PFE component \nalso reflects the risk-reducing property of excess collateral. [Basel Framework, CRE 52.21] \n117. For prudential reasons and in line with Basel Committee direction, OSFI applied a \nmultiplier to the PFE component that decreases as excess collateral increases, without reaching \nzero (the multiplier is floored at 5% of the PFE add-on). When the collateral held is less than the \nnet market value of the derivative contracts (‚Äúunder-collateralization‚Äù), the current replacement \ncost is positive and the multiplier is equal to one (i.e. the PFE component is equal to the full \nvalue of the aggregate add-on).

For more complex trades that may have more than one risk driver (e.g., multi-asset or \nhybrid derivatives), institutions must take sensitivities and volatility of the underlying into \naccount for determining the primary risk driver.  \nOSFI may also require more complex trades to be allocated to more than one asset class, \nresulting in the same position being included in multiple classes.

For each transaction, the primary risk factor or factors need to be determined and \nattributed to one or more of the five asset classes: interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, equity \nor commodity. The add-on for each asset class is calculated using asset-class-specific formulas \nthat represent a stylized Effective EPE calculation under the assumption that all trades in the \nasset class have zero current mark-to-market value (i.e. they are at-the-money). [Basel \nFramework, CRE 52.29] \n123. Although the add-on formulas are asset class-specific, they have a number of features in \ncommon. To determine the add-on, transactions in each asset class are subject to adjustment in \nthe following general steps: \n1) The effective notional (D) must be calculated for each derivative (i.e. each individual \ntrade) in the netting set. The effective notional is a measure of the sensitivity of the trade \nto movements in the underlying risk factors (i.e. interest rates, exchange rates, credit \nspreads, equity prices and commodity prices). The effective notional is calculated as the \nproduct of the following parameters (i.e. D = d √ó MF √ó Œ¥): \na. The adjustment notional (d). The adjusted notional is a measure of the size of \nthe trade. For derivatives in the foreign exchange asset class this is simply the \nnotional value of the foreign currency leg of the derivative contracted, converted \nto the domestic currency. For derivatives in the equity and commodity asset \nclasses, it is simply the current price of the relevant share or unit of commodity \nmultiplied by the number of shares/units that the derivative references. For \nderivatives in the interest rate and credit asset classes, the notional amount is \nadjusted by a measure of the duration of the instrument to account for the fact that \nthe value of the instruments with longer durations are more sensitive to \nmovements in underlying risk factors (i.e. interest rates and credit spreads). \nb. The maturity factor (MF). The maturity factor is a parameter that takes account \nof the time period over which the potential future exposure is calculated. The \ncalculation of the maturity factor varies depending on whether the netting set is \nmargined or unmargined.  \nc. The supervisory delta (Œ¥). The supervisory delta ensures the effective notional \ntakes into account the direction of the trade, i.e. whether the trade is long or short, \nby having a positive or negative sign. It is also takes into account whether the",

The \nsupervisory factor is the supervisory specified change in value of the underlying risk \nfactor on which the potential future exposure calculation is based, which has been \ncalibrated to take into account the volatility of underlying risk factors. \n3) The trades within each asset class are separated into supervisory specified hedging sets. \nThe purpose of the hedging sets is to group together trades within the netting set where \nlong and short positions should be permitted to offset each other in the calculation of the \npotential future exposure. \n4) Aggregation formulas are applied to aggregate the effective notionals and supervisory \nfactors across all trades within each hedging set and finally at the asset-class level to give \nthe asset class level add-on. The method of aggregation varies between assets classes and \nfor credit, equity and commodity derivatives. It also involves the application of \nsupervisory correlation parameters to capture diversification of the trades and basis risk. \n [Basel Framework, CRE 52.30] \n7.1.7.7 Time Period Parameters Mi, Ei, Si, and Ti \n124.

For foreign exchange derivatives, the adjusted notional is defined as the notional of the \nforeign currency leg of the contract, converted to the domestic currency. If both legs of a foreign \nexchange derivative are denominated in currencies other than the domestic currency, the notional \namount of each leg is converted to the domestic currency and the leg with the larger domestic \ncurrency value is the adjusted notional amount. [Basel Framework, CRE 52.35] \n129. For equity and commodity derivatives, the adjusted notional is defined as the product of \nthe current price of one unit of the stock or commodity (e.g., a share of equity or barrel of oil) \nand the number of units referenced by the trade. For equity and commodity volatility \ntransactions, the underlying volatility or variance referenced by the transactions should replace \nthe unit price and the contractual notional should replace the number of units. \n[Basel Framework, CRE52.36] \n \n130. In many cases the trade notional amount is stated clearly and fixed until maturity. When \nthis is not the case, institutions must use the following rules to determine the trade notional \namount. \n‚Ä¢ Where the notional is a formula of market values, the institution must enter the current \nmarket values to determine the trade notional amount.  \n‚Ä¢ For all interest rate and credit derivatives with variable notional amounts specified in the \ncontract (such as amortizing and accreting swaps), institutions must use the average \nnotional over the remaining life of the swap as the trade notional amount. The average \nshould be calculated as ‚Äútime weighted‚Äù. The averaging described in this paragraph does \nnot cover transactions where the notional varies due to price changes (typically FX, \nequity and commodity derivatives). \n‚Ä¢ Leveraged swaps must be converted to the notional of the equivalent unleveraged swap, \nthat is, where all rates in a swap are multiplied by a factor, the stated notional must be \nmultiplied by the factor on the interest rates to determine the trade notional amount.  \n‚Ä¢ For a derivative contract with multiple exchanges of principal, the notional is multiplied \nby the number of exchanges of principal in the derivative contract to determine the trade \nnotional amount.  \n‚Ä¢ For a derivative contract that is structured such that on specified dates any outstanding \nexposure is settled and the terms are reset so that the fair value of the contract is zero, the \nremaining maturity equals the time until the next reset date.  \n \n26  There is a distinction between the time period of the underlying transaction and the remaining maturity of the \nderivative contract.

The add-on for interest rate derivatives captures the risk of interest rate derivatives of \ndifferent maturities being imperfectly correlated. It does this by allocating trades to maturity \nbuckets, in which full offsetting of long and short positions is permitted, and by using an \naggregation formula that only permits limited offsetting between transactions in different \nmaturity buckets. This allocation of derivatives to maturity buckets and the process of \naggregation are only used in the interest rate derivative asset class.[Basel Framework, CRE \n52.56] \n147. The add-on for interest rate derivatives within a netting set is calculated using the \nfollowing steps.  \n(1) Step 1: Calculate the effective notional for each trade in the netting set that is in the rate \nderivative asset class. The is calculated as the product of the following three terms (i) the \nadjusted notional of the trade (d); (ii) the supervisory delta adjustment of the trade (Œ¥); and (iii) \nthe maturity factor (MF). That is, for each trade i, D\ni = di x Œ¥i x MFi. \n(2) Step 2: Allocate the trades in the interest rate derivative asset class to hedging sets. In the \ninterest rate derivative asset class the hedging sets consist of all the derivatives that reference the \nsame currency. \n(3) Step 3: Within each hedging set, allocate each of the trades to the following three maturity \nbuckets: less than one year (bucket 1), between one and five years (bucket 2) and more than five \nyears (bucket 3). \n(4) Step 4: Calculate the effective notional of each maturity bucket by adding together all the \ntrade-level effective notionals calculated in step 1 of the trades within the maturity bucket.

The formula to recognized partial offsetting in step 4 above, is a single-factor model, \nwhich divides the risk of the credit derivative asset class into a systemic component and an \nidiosyncratic component. The entity level add-ons are allowed to offset each other fully in the \nsystemic component, whereas, there is no offsetting benefit in the idiosyncratic component. \nThese two components are weighted by a correlation factor which determines the degree of \noffsetting/hedging benefit within the credit derivative asset class. The higher the correlation \nfactor, the higher the importance of the systemic component, hence the higher the degree of \noffsetting benefits. [Basel Framework, CRE 52.62] \n \n153. It should be noted that a higher or lower correlation does not necessarily mean a higher \nor lower capital charge. For portfolios consisting of long and short credit positions, a high \ncorrelation factor would reduce the charge. For portfolios consisting exclusively of long \npositions (or short positions), a higher correlation factor would increase the charge. If most of the \nrisk consists of systematic risk, then individual reference entities would be highly correlated and \nlong and short positions should offset each other. If, however, most of the risk is idiosyncratic to \na reference entity, then individual long and short positions would not be effective hedges for \neach other. [Basel Framework, CRE 52.63] \n154. The use of a single hedging set for credit derivatives implies that credit derivatives from \ndifferent industries and regions are equally able to offset the systematic component of an \nexposure, although they would not be able to offset the idiosyncratic portion.

The client must have conducted a sufficient legal review (and undertake such \nfurther review as necessary to ensure continuing enforceability) and have a well \nfounded basis to conclude that, in the event of legal challenge, the relevant courts \nand administrative authorities would find that such arrangements mentioned \nabove would be legal, valid, binding and enforceable under the relevant laws of \nthe relevant jurisdiction(s). \n(2) Relevant laws, regulation, rules, contractual, or administrative arrangements provide that \nthe offsetting transactions with the defaulted or insolvent clearing member are highly \nlikely to continue to be indirectly transacted through the CCP, or by the CCP, if the \nclearing member defaults or becomes insolvent. In such circumstances, the client \npositions and collateral with the CCP will be transferred at market value unless the client \nrequests to close out the position at market value. Regarding the condition set out in this \nparagraph, if there is a clear precedent for transactions being ported at a CCP and \nindustry intent for this practice to continue, then these factors must be considered when \nassessing if trades are highly likely to be ported. The fact that CCP documentation does \nnot prohibit client trades from being ported is not sufficient to say they are highly likely \nto be ported. \n[Basel Framework, CRE 54.15] \n \n183. Where a client is not protected from losses in the case that the clearing member and \nanother client of the clearing member jointly default or become jointly insolvent, but all other \nconditions in the preceding paragraph are met, a risk weight of 4% will apply to the client‚Äôs \nexposure to the clearing member, or to the higher level client, respectively. [Basel Framework, \nCRE 53.16] \n184. Where the institution is a client of the clearing member and the requirements in \nparagraphs 181 to 183 are not met, the institution will capitalize its exposure (including potential \nCVA risk exposure) to the clearing member as a bilateral trade.

In addition to the requirements in paragraph 185 above, the posted assets or collateral \nare subject to counterparty credit risk requirements, regardless of whether they are in the banking \nor trading book. This includes the increase in the counterparty credit risk exposure due to the \napplication of haircuts. The counterparty credit risk requirements arise where assets or collateral \nof a clearing member or client are posted with a CCP or a clearing member and are not held in a \nbankruptcy remote manner. In such cases, the institution posting such assets or collateral must \nalso recognize the credit risk based upon the assets or collateral being exposed to risk of loss \nbased on the creditworthiness of the entity holding such assets or collateral, as described further \nbelow. [Basel Framework, CRE 54.19] \n187. Where such collateral is included in the definition of trade exposures and the entity \nholding the collateral is the CCP, the following risk weights apply where the assets or collateral \nis not held on a bankruptcy-remote basis: \n(1) For institutions that are clearing members a risk-weight of 2% applies. \n(2) For institutions that are clients of clearing members: \na) A 2% risk weight applies if the conditions in paragraph 181 and 182 are met; or \nb) A 4% risk weight applied if the conditions in paragraph 183 are met \n[Basel Framework, CRE 54.20] \n188. Where such collateral is included in the definition of trades exposures, there is no \ncapital requirement for counterparty credit risk exposures if the collateral is: (a) held by a \ncustodian;\n44 and (b) bankruptcy remote from the CCP. Regarding this paragraph, all forms of \ncollateral are included, such as: cash, securities, other pledged assets, and excess initial or \nvariation margin, also called overcollateralization, that is held by a custodian, and is bankruptcy \nremote from the CCP, is not subject to a capital requirement for counterparty credit risk exposure \n \n43  Collateral posted must receive the banking book or trading book treatment it would receive if it had not been \nposted to the CCP. In addition, this collateral is subject to the CCR framework of the Basel rules, regardless of \nwhether it is in the banking or trading book. This includes the increase due to haircuts under either the \nstandardized supervisory haircuts or the own estimates.   \n44  In this paragraph, the word ‚Äúcustodian‚Äù may include a trustee, agent, pledgee, secured creditor or any other  \nperson that holds property in a way that does not give such person a beneficial interest in such property and will \nnot result in such property being subject to legally-enforceable claims by such persons creditors, or to a court-\nordered stay of the return of such property, if such person becomes insolvent or bankrupt.",

For DvP transactions, if the payments have not yet taken place five business days after \nthe settlement date, firms must calculate a capital charge by multiplying the positive current \nexposure of the transaction by the appropriate factor, according to the Table 3. \n \n \nTable 3 \nNumber of working days after the \nagreed settlement date \nCorresponding risk multiplier \nFrom 5 to 15 8% \nFrom 16 to 30 50% \nFrom 31 to 45 75% \n46 or more 100% \n[Basel Framework, CRE 70.9] \n \n218. For non-DvP transactions (i.e., free deliveries), after the first contractual \npayment/delivery leg, the institution that has made the payment will treat its exposure as a loan if \nthe second leg has not been received by the end of the business day.\n50 This means that an \ninstitution under the IRB approach will apply the appropriate IRB formula set out in this \nguideline, for the exposure to the counterparty, in the same way as it does for all other banking \nbook exposures. Similarly, institutions under the standardized approach will use the standardized \nrisk weights set forth in this guideline. However, when exposures are not material, institutions \nmay choose to apply a uniform 100% risk-weight to these exposures, in order to avoid the \nburden of a full credit assessment. If five business days after the second contractual \npayment/delivery date the second leg has not yet effectively taken place, the institution that has \nmade the first payment leg will deduct from capital the full amount of the value transferred plus \nreplacement cost, if any. This treatment will apply until the second payment/delivery leg is \neffectively made.  [Basel Framework, CRE 70.4] \n \n \n50  If the dates when two payment legs are made are the same according to the time zones where each payment is \nmade, it is deemed that they are settled on the same day. For example, if a bank in Tokyo transfers Yen on day X \n(Japan Standard Time) and receives corresponding US Dollar via CHIPS on day X (US Eastern Standard Time), \nthe settlement is deemed to take place on the same value date.",

This chapter is drawn from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) market \nrisk framework, which includes Minimum capital requirements for market risk (January 2019)1.  \nFor reference, the Basel text paragraph numbers that are associated with the text appearing in this \nchapter are indicated in square brackets at the end of each paragraph.2  \n2. These requirements apply only to internationally active institutions.  \n3. OSFI retains the right to apply the framework to other institutions, on a case by case \nbasis. All institutions designated by OSFI as domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs) \nshall meet the requirements of this chapter. \n9.1. Market Risk Terminology, Definition and Application  \n9.1.1 MARKET RISK TERMINOLOGY \nThis section provides a high-level description of terminologies used in the market risk \nframeworks. \n9.1.1.1  General Terminology \n4. Market risk: the risk of losses in on- and off-balance sheet risk positions arising from \nmovements in market prices. [Basel Framework, MAR10.1] \n5. Notional value: the notional value of a derivative instrument is equal to the number of \nunits underlying the instrument multiplied by the current market value of each unit of the \nunderlying. [Basel Framework, MAR10.2] \n6. Trading desk: a group of traders or trading accounts in a business line within an \ninstitution that follows defined trading strategies with the goal of generating revenues or \nmaintaining market presence from assuming and managing risk. [Basel Framework, MAR10.3] \n7. Pricing model: a model that is used to determine the value of an instrument (mark-to-\nmarket or mark-to-model) as a function of pricing parameters or to determine the change in the \nvalue of an instrument as a function of risk factors. A pricing model may be the combination of \nseveral calculations; e.g. a first valuation technique to compute a price, followed by valuation \nadjustments for risks that are not incorporated in the first step. [Basel Framework, MAR10.4] \n8. Rating Agencies: OSFI conducted a process to determine which of the major international \nrating agencies would be recognized as an eligible external credit assessment institution under \nthis chapter. As a result of this process, OSFI will permit institutions to recognize credit ratings \n \n1 Minimum capital requirements for market risk (which includes previously published frequently asked questions  \n  (FAQs). \n2 Following the format: [Basel Framework, XXX yy.zz].",

Financial instrument: any contract that gives rise to both a financial asset of one entity \nand a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Financial instruments include \nprimary financial instruments (or cash instruments) and derivative financial instruments. [Basel \nFramework, MAR10.5]  \n10. Instrument: the term used to describe financial instruments, instruments on foreign \nexchange (FX) and commodities. [Basel Framework, MAR10.6] \n11. Embedded derivative: a component of a financial instrument that includes a non-\nderivative host contract. For example, the conversion option in a convertible bond is an \nembedded derivative. [Basel Framework, MAR10.7] \n12. Look-through approach: an approach in which an institution determines the relevant \ncapital requirements for a position that has underlyings (such as an index instrument, multi-\nunderlying option, or an equity investment in a fund) as if the underlying positions were held \ndirectly by the institution. [Basel Framework, MAR10.8] \n9.1.1.3  Terminology for Market Risk Capital Requirement Calculations  \n13. Risk factor: a principal determinant of the change in value of an instrument (e.g. an \nexchange rate or interest rate). [Basel Framework, MAR10.9] \n14. Risk position: the portion of the current value of an instrument that may be subject to \nlosses due to movements in a risk factor. For example, a bond denominated in a currency \ndifferent to an institution‚Äôs reporting currency has risk positions in general interest rate risk, \ncredit spread risk (non-securitization) and FX risk, where the risk positions are the potential \nlosses to the current value of the instrument that could occur due to a change in the relevant \nunderlying risk factors (interest rates, credit spreads, or exchange rates). [Basel Framework, \nMAR10.10] \n15. Risk bucket: a defined group of risk factors with similar characteristics. [Basel \nFramework, MAR10.11] \n16. Risk class: a defined list of risks that are used as the basis for calculating market risk \ncapital requirements: general interest rate risk, credit spread risk (non-securitization), credit \nspread risk (securitization: non-correlation trading portfolio), credit spread risk (securitization: \ncorrelation trading portfolio), FX risk, equity risk and commodity risk.

Sensitivity: an institution‚Äôs estimate of the change in value of an instrument due to a small \nchange in one of its underlying risk factors. Delta and vega risks are sensitivities. [Basel \nFramework, MAR10.13] \n18. Delta risk: the linear estimate of the change in value of a financial instrument due to a \nmovement in the value of a risk factor. The risk factor could be the price of an equity or \ncommodity, or a change in an interest rate, credit spread or FX rate. [Basel Framework, \nMAR10.14] \n19. Vega risk: the potential loss resulting from the change in value of a derivative due to a \nchange in the implied volatility of its underlying. [Basel Framework, MAR10.15] \n20. Curvature risk: the additional potential loss beyond delta risk due to a change in a risk \nfactor for financial instruments with optionality. In the standardized approach in the market risk \nframework, it is based on two stress scenarios involving an upward shock and a downward shock \nto each regulatory risk factor. [Basel Framework, MAR10.16]  \n21. Value at risk (VaR): a measure of the worst expected loss on a portfolio of instruments \nresulting from market movements over a given time horizon and a pre-defined confidence level. \n[Basel Framework, MAR10.17] \n22. Expected shortfall (ES): a measure of the average of all potential losses exceeding the \nVaR at a given confidence level. [Basel Framework, MAR10.18] \n23. Jump-to-default (JTD): the risk of a sudden default. JTD exposure refers to the loss that \ncould be incurred from a JTD event. [Basel Framework, MAR10.19] \n24. Liquidity horizon: the time assumed to be required to exit or hedge a risk position without \nmaterially affecting market prices in stressed market conditions. [Basel Framework, MAR10.20] \n9.1.1.5  Terminology for Hedging and Diversification \n25. Basis risk: the risk that prices of financial instruments in a hedging strategy are \nimperfectly correlated, reducing the effectiveness of the hedging strategy. [Basel Framework, \nMAR10.21] \n26. Diversification: the reduction in risk at a portfolio level due to holding risk positions in \ndifferent instruments that are not perfectly correlated with one another. [Basel Framework, \nMAR10.22] \n27. Hedge: the process of counterbalancing risks from exposures to long and short risk \npositions in correlated instruments. [Basel Framework, MAR10.23] \n28. Offset: the process of netting exposures to long and short risk positions in the same risk \nfactor. [Basel Framework, MAR10.24]",

[Basel Framework, MAR10.25] \n9.1.1.6  Terminology for Risk Factor Eligibility and Modellability \n30. Real prices: a term used for assessing whether risk factors pass the risk factor eligibility \ntest. A price will be considered real if it is (i) a price from an actual transaction conducted by the \ninstitution, (ii) a price from an actual transaction between other arm‚Äôs length parties (e.g. at an \nexchange), or (iii) a price taken from a firm quote (i.e. a price at which the institution could \ntransact with an arm‚Äôs length party). [Basel Framework, MAR10.26] \n31. Modellable risk factor: risk factors that are deemed modellable, based on the number of \nrepresentative real price observations and additional qualitative principles related to the data used \nfor the calibration of the ES model. Risk factors that do not meet the requirements for the risk \nfactor eligibility test are deemed as non-modellable risk factors (NMRF). [Basel Framework, \nMAR10.27] \n9.1.1.7  Terminology for Internal Model Validation \n32. Backtesting: the process of comparing daily actual and hypothetical profits and losses \nwith model-generated VaR measures to assess the conservatism of risk measurement systems. \n[Basel Framework, MAR10.28] \n33. Profit and loss (P&L) attribution (PLA): a method for assessing the robustness of \ninstitutions‚Äô risk management models by comparing the risk-theoretical P&L predicted by \ntrading desk risk management models with the hypothetical P&L. [Basel Framework, \nMAR10.29] \n34. Trading desk risk management model: the trading desk risk management model \n(pertaining to in-scope desks) includes all risk factors that are included in the institution‚Äôs ES \nmodel with OSFI parameters and any risk factors deemed not modellable, which are therefore \nnot included in the ES model for calculating the respective regulatory capital requirement, but \nare included in NMRFs. [Basel Framework, MAR10.30] \n35. Actual P&L (APL): the actual P&L derived from the daily P&L process. It includes \nintraday trading as well as time effects and new and modified deals, but excludes fees and \ncommissions as well as valuation adjustments for which separate regulatory capital approaches \nhave been otherwise specified as part of the rules or which are deducted from Common Equity \nTier 1 (CET1). Any other valuation adjustments that are market risk-related must be included in \nthe APL. As is the case for the hypothetical P&L, the APL should include FX and commodity \nrisks from positions held in the banking book. [Basel Framework, MAR10.31] \n36. Hypothetical P&L (HPL): the daily P&L produced by revaluing the positions held at the \nend of the previous day using the market data at the end of the current day.

Market risk is defined as the risk of losses arising from movements in market prices. The \nrisks subject to market risk capital requirements include but are not limited to: \n(1) default risk, interest rate risk, credit spread risk, equity risk, foreign exchange (FX) risk \nand commodities risk for trading book instruments; and \n(2) FX risk and commodities risk for banking book instruments. \n[Basel Framework, MAR11.1] \n41. Derivative, repurchase/reverse repurchase, securities lending and other transactions \nbooked in the trading book are subject to both the market risk and the counterparty credit risk \ncapital requirements. This is because they face the risk of loss due to market fluctuations in the \nvalue of the underlying instrument and due to the failure of the counterparty to the contract. The \ncounterparty risk weights used to calculate the credit risk capital requirements for these \ntransactions are those used for calculating the capital requirements in the banking book. \n42. All transactions, including forward sales and purchases, shall be included in the \ncalculation of capital requirements as of the date on which they were entered into. Although \nregular reporting will in principle take place only at intervals (quarterly in most countries), \ninstitutions are expected to manage their market risk in such a way that the capital requirements \nare being met on a continuous basis, including at the close of each business day. OSFI has at its \ndisposal a number of effective measures to ensure that institutions do not window-dress by \nshowing significantly lower market risk positions on reporting dates.

A matched currency risk position will protect an institution against loss from movements \nin exchange rates, but will not necessarily protect its capital adequacy ratio. If an institution has \nits capital denominated in its domestic currency and has a portfolio of foreign currency assets \nand liabilities that is completely matched, its capital/asset ratio will fall if the domestic currency \ndepreciates.

In determining its market risk for regulatory capital requirements, an institution may \nchoose between two broad methodologies: the standardized approach and internal models \napproach (IMA) for market risk, described in section 9.5 and section 9.6, respectively, subject to \nthe approval of OSFI. [Basel Framework, MAR11.7] \n49. All institutions must calculate the capital requirements using the standardized approach. \nInstitutions that are approved by OSFI to use the IMA for market risk capital requirements must \nalso calculate and report the capital requirement values calculated as set out below.  \n(1) An institution that uses the IMA for any of its trading desks must also calculate the \ncapital requirement under the standardized approach for all instruments across all trading \ndesks, regardless of whether those trading desks are eligible for the IMA. \n(2) In addition, an institution that uses the IMA for any of its trading desks must calculate the \nstandardized approach capital requirement for each trading desk that is eligible for the \nIMA as if that trading desk were a standalone regulatory portfolio (i.e. with no offsetting \nacross trading desks). This will: \n(a) serve as an indication of the fallback capital requirement for those desks that fail \nthe eligibility criteria for inclusion in the institution‚Äôs internal model as outlined \nin section 9.6;  \n(b) generate information on the capital outcomes of the internal models relative to a \nconsistent benchmark and facilitate comparison in implementation between \ninstitutions and/or across jurisdictions; \n(c) monitor over time the relative calibration of standardized and modelled \napproaches, facilitating adjustments as needed; and \n(d) provide macroprudential insight in an ex ante consistent format. \n[Basel Framework, MAR11.8] \n50.

As a consequence, such products can be treated as \nnon-securitized positions for the purposes of credit spread risk capital requirements based on \neither the standardized framework or internal models.

For the purposes of market risk capital calculations, a trading desk is a group of traders or \ntrading accounts that implements a well-defined business strategy operating within a clear risk \nmanagement structure. [Basel Framework, MAR12.1] \n53. Trading desks are defined by the institution but subject to the regulatory approval of \nOSFI for capital purposes.  \n(1) An institution should be allowed to propose the trading desk structure per their \norganizational structure, consistent with the requirements set out in paragraph 55. \n(2) An institution must prepare a policy document for each trading desk it defines, \ndocumenting how the institution satisfies the key elements in paragraph 55. \n(3) OSFI will treat the definition of the trading desk as part of the initial model approval for \nthe trading desk, as well as ongoing approval. \n(a) OSFI may determine, based on the size of the institution‚Äôs overall trading \noperations, whether the proposed trading desk definitions are sufficiently \ngranular. \n(b) OSFI will check that the institution‚Äôs proposed definition of trading desk meets \nthe criteria listed in key elements set out in paragraph 55.  \n[Basel Framework, MAR12.2] \n54. Within this OSFI-approved trading desk structure, institutions may further define \noperational subdesks without the need for OSFI approval. These subdesks would be for internal \noperational purposes only and would not be used in the market risk capital framework. [Basel \nFramework, MAR12.3] \n55. The key attributes of a trading desk are as follows: \n(1) A trading desk for the purposes of the regulatory capital charge is an unambiguously \ndefined group of traders or trading accounts.   \n(a) A trading account is an indisputable and unambiguous unit of observation in \naccounting for trading activity. \n(b) The trading desk must have one head trader and can have up to two head traders \nprovided their roles, responsibilities and authorities are either clearly separated or \none has ultimate oversight over the other. \n(i) The head trader must have direct oversight of the group of traders or \ntrading accounts. \n(ii) Each trader or each trading account in the trading desk must have a clearly \ndefined specialty (or specialties).",

A trading book consists of all instruments that meet the specifications for trading book \ninstruments set out in paragraphs 59 through 70. All other instruments must be included in the \nbanking book. [Basel Framework, RBC25.1] \n59. Instruments comprise financial instruments, foreign exchange (FX), and commodities. A \nfinancial instrument is any contract that gives rise to both a financial asset of one entity and a \nfinancial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Financial instruments include primary \nfinancial instruments (or cash instruments) and derivative financial instruments. A financial asset \nis any asset that is cash, the right to receive cash or another financial asset or a commodity, or an \nequity instrument. A financial liability is the contractual obligation to deliver cash or another \nfinancial asset or a commodity. Commodities also include non-tangible (i.e. non-physical) goods \nsuch as electric power. \nThe CSR capital requirement applies to money market instruments to the extent such instruments \nare covered instruments (i.e. they meet the definition of instruments to be included in the trading \nbook as specified in paragraphs 59 through 70.

Institutions may only include a financial instrument, instruments on FX or commodity in \nthe trading book when there is no legal impediment against selling or fully hedging it. [Basel \nFramework, RBC25.3] \n61. Institutions must fair value daily any trading book instrument and recognize any \nvaluation change in the profit and loss (P&L) account. \nInstruments designated under the fair value option may be allocated to the trading book, but only \nif they comply with all the relevant requirements for trading book instruments set out in section \n9.2.

Any instrument an institution holds for one or more of the following purposes must, \nwhen it is first recognised on its books, be designated as a trading book instrument, unless \nspecifically otherwise provided for in paragraph 60 or paragraph 64: \n(1) short-term resale; \n(2) profiting from short-term price movements;  \n(3) locking in arbitrage profits; or \n(4) hedging risks that arise from instruments meeting (1), (2) or (3) above.",

[Basel Framework, CRE55] \n9.4. Prudent Valuation Guidance \n9.4.1 Introduction \n94. This section provides institutions with guidance on prudent valuation for positions that \nare accounted for at fair value, whether they are in the trading book or in the banking book. This \nguidance is especially important for positions without actual market prices or observable inputs \nto valuation, as well as less liquid positions which raise OSFI concerns about prudent valuation. \nThe valuation guidance set forth below is not intended to require institutions to change valuation \nprocedures for financial reporting purposes. OSFI will assess an institution‚Äôs valuation \nprocedures for consistency with this guidance. One fact in OSFI‚Äôs assessment of whether an \ninstitution must take a valuation adjustment for regulatory purposes under paragraphs 104 to 107 \nshould be the degree of consistency between the institution‚Äôs valuation procedures and these \nguidelines. [Basel Framework, CAP50.1] \n95. A framework for prudent valuation practices should at a minimum include the following. \n[Basel Framework, CAP50.2] \n9.4.2 Systems and Controls \n96. Institutions must establish and maintain adequate systems and controls sufficient to give \nmanagement and OSFI the confidence that their valuation estimates are prudent and reliable. \nThese systems must be integrated with other risk management systems within the organization \n(such as credit analysis). Such systems must include: \n(1) Documented policies and procedures for the process of valuation. This includes clearly \ndefined responsibilities of the various areas involved in the determination of the \nvaluation, sources of market information and review of their appropriateness, guidelines \nfor the use of unobservable inputs reflecting the institution‚Äôs assumptions of what market \nparticipants would use in pricing the position, frequency of independent valuation, timing \nof closing prices, procedures for adjusting valuations, end of the month and ad-hoc \nverification procedures; and \n(2) Clear and independent (i.e. independent of front office) reporting lines for the department \naccountable for the valuation process. The reporting line should ultimately be to a main \nmember of senior management. \n[Basel Framework, CAP50.3] \n9.4.3 Valuation Methodologies \nMarking to market \n97. Marking-to-market is at least the daily valuation of positions at readily available close out \nprices that are sourced independently. Examples of readily available close out prices include",

[Basel \nFramework, CAP50.4] \n98. Institutions must mark-to-market as much as possible. The more prudent side of bid/offer \nshould be used unless the institution is a significant market maker in a particular position type \nand it can close out at mid-market. Institutions should maximise the use of relevant observable \ninputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs when estimating fair value using a valuation \ntechnique. However, observable inputs or transactions may not be relevant, such as in a forced \nliquidation or distressed sale, or transactions may not be observable, such as when markets are \ninactive. In such cases, the observable data should be considered, but may not be determinative. \n[Basel Framework, CAP50.5] \nMarking to model \n99. Only where marking-to-market is not possible should institutions mark-to-model, but this \nmust be demonstrated to be prudent. Marking-to-model is defined as any valuation which has to \nbe benchmarked, extrapolated or otherwise calculated from a market input. When marking to \nmodel, an extra degree of conservatism is appropriate. OSFI will consider the following in \nassessing whether a mark-to-model valuation is prudent: \n(1) Senior management should be aware of the elements of the trading book or other fair-\nvalued positions which are subject to mark to model and should understand the \nmateriality of the uncertainty this creates in the reporting of the risk/performance of the \nbusiness. \n(2) Market inputs should be sourced, to the extent possible, in line with market prices (as \ndiscussed above). The appropriateness of the market inputs for the particular position \nbeing valued should be reviewed regularly. \n(3) Where available, generally accepted valuation methodologies for particular products \nshould be used as far as possible. \n(4) Where the model is developed by the institution itself, it should be based on appropriate \nassumptions, which have been assessed and challenged by suitably qualified parties \nindependent of the development process. The model should be developed or approved \nindependently of the front office. It should be independently tested. This includes \nvalidating the mathematics, the assumptions and the software implementation. \n(5) There should be formal change control procedures in place and a secure copy of the \nmodel should be held and periodically used to check valuations. \n(6) Risk management should be aware of the weaknesses of the models used and how best to \nreflect those in the valuation output. \n(7) The model should be subject to periodic review to determine the accuracy of its \nperformance (e.g. assessing continued appropriateness of the assumptions, analysis of \nprofit and loss versus risk factors, comparison of actual close out values to model \noutputs).",

Independent price verification is distinct from daily mark-to-market. It is the process by \nwhich market prices or model inputs are regularly verified for accuracy. While daily marking-to-\nmarket may be performed by dealers, verification of market prices or model inputs should be \nperformed by a unit independent of the dealing room, at least monthly (or, depending on the \nnature of the market/trading activity, more frequently). It need not be performed as frequently as \ndaily mark-to-market, since the objective, i.e. independent, marking of positions, should reveal \nany error or bias in pricing, which should result in the elimination of inaccurate daily marks. \n[Basel Framework, CAP50.7] \n101. Independent price verification entails a higher standard of accuracy in that the market \nprices or model inputs are used to determine profit and loss figures, whereas daily marks are \nused primarily for management reporting in between reporting dates. For independent price \nverification, where pricing sources are more subjective, e.g. only one available broker quote, \nprudent measures such as valuation adjustments may be appropriate. [Basel Framework, \nCAP50.8] \n9.4.4 Valuation Adjustments  \n102. As part of their procedures for marking to market, institutions must establish and \nmaintain procedures for considering valuation adjustments. OSFI expects institutions using third-\nparty valuations to consider whether valuation adjustments are necessary. Such considerations \nare also necessary when marking to model. [Basel Framework, CAP50.9] \n103. OSFI expects the following valuation adjustments/reserves to be formally considered at a \nminimum: unearned credit spreads, close-out costs, operational risks, early termination, investing \nand funding costs, and future administrative costs and, where appropriate, model risk. OSFI also \nexpects that the valuation adjustment will be considered for positions individually (i.e. \nadjustments should be reflected in the valuation of the individual transactions) rather than on a \nportfolio level (i.e. adjustments are made in the form of a reserve for a portfolio of exposures and \nare not reflected in the valuation of the individual transactions). [Basel Framework, CAP50.10] \n9.4.5 Adjustment to the Current Valuation of Less Liquid Positions for Regulatory \nCapital Purposes \n104. Institutions must establish and maintain procedures for judging the necessity of and \ncalculating an adjustment to the current valuation of less liquid positions for regulatory capital \npurposes. This adjustment may be in addition to any changes to the value of the position required \nfor financial reporting purposes and should be designed to reflect the illiquidity of the position. \nOSFI expects institutions to consider the need for an adjustment to a position‚Äôs valuation to",

[Basel Framework, CAP50.11] \n105. Bearing in mind that the assumptions made about liquidity in the market risk capital \nrequirement may not be consistent with the institution‚Äôs ability to sell or hedge out less liquid \npositions, where appropriate, institutions must take an adjustment to the current valuation of \nthese positions, and review their continued appropriateness on an on-going basis. Reduced \nliquidity may have arisen from market events. Additionally, close-out prices for concentrated \npositions and/or stale positions should be considered in establishing the adjustment. Institutions \nmust consider all relevant factors when determining the appropriateness of the adjustment for \nless liquid positions. These factors may include, but are not limited to, the amount of time it \nwould take to hedge out the position/risks within the position, the average volatility of bid/offer \nspreads, the availability of independent market quotes (number and identity of market makers), \nthe average and volatility of trading volumes (including trading volumes during periods of \nmarket stress), market concentrations, the aging of positions, the extent to which valuation relies \non marking-to-model, and the impact of other model risks not included in the paragraph above. \n[Basel Framework, CAP50.12] \n106. For complex products including, but not limited to, securitization exposures and n-th-to-\ndefault credit derivatives, institutions must explicitly assess the need for valuation adjustments to \nreflect two forms of model risk: the model risk associated with using a possibly incorrect \nvaluation methodology; and the risk associated with using unobservable (and possibly incorrect) \ncalibration parameters in the valuation model.

An institution must also determine its regulatory capital requirements for market risk \naccording to the standardized approach for market risk at the demand of OSFI. [Basel \nFramework, MAR20.3] \n9.5.1.2  Structure of the Standardized Approach \n111. The standardized approach capital requirement is the simple sum of three components: \nthe capital requirement under the sensitivities-based method, the default risk capital (DRC) \nrequirement and the residual risk add-on (RRAO).  \n(1) The capital requirement under the sensitivities-based method must be calculated by \naggregating three risk measures ‚Äì delta, vega and curvature, as set out in section 9.5.2: \n(a) Delta: a risk measure based on sensitivities of an instrument to regulatory delta \nrisk factors.  \n(b) Vega: a risk measure based on sensitivities to regulatory vega risk factors.  \n(c) Curvature: a risk measure which captures the incremental risk not captured by the \ndelta risk measure for price changes in an option. Curvature risk is based on two \nstress scenarios involving an upward shock and a downward shock to each \nregulatory risk factor.  \n(d) The above three risk measures specify risk weights to be applied to the regulatory \nrisk factor sensitivities. To calculate the overall capital requirement, the risk-\nweighted sensitivities are aggregated using specified correlation parameters to \nrecognize diversification benefits between risk factors. In order to address the risk \nthat correlations may increase or decrease in periods of financial stress, an \ninstitution must calculate three sensitivities-based method capital requirement \nvalues, based on three different scenarios on the specified values for the \ncorrelation parameters as set out in paragraphs 118 and 119.   \n(2) The DRC requirement captures the jump-to-default risk for instruments subject to credit \nrisk as set out in paragraph 215. It is calibrated based on the credit risk treatment in the \nbanking book in order to reduce the potential discrepancy in capital requirements for \nsimilar risk exposures across the institution. Some hedging recognition is allowed for \nsimilar types of exposures (corporates, sovereigns, and local \ngovernments/municipalities). \n(3) Given recognition that not all market risks can be captured in the standardized approach \nso as to avoid an unduly complex regime, an RRAO ensures sufficient coverage of \nmarket risks for instruments specified in paragraph 259. The calculation method for the \nRRAO is set out in paragraph 265. \n[Basel Framework, MAR20.4]",

For instance, if an \ninstitution‚Äôs portfolio is made of two interest rate swaps on three-month Euribor with the \nsame fixed rate and same notional but of opposite direction, the GIRR on that portfolio \nwould be zero. \n(3) The weighted sensitivity ùëäùëäùëÜùëÜ\nùëòùëò is the product of the net sensitivity ùë†ùë†ùëòùëò and the \ncorresponding risk weight RWk as defined in paragraphs 151 to 207. \nùëäùëäùëÜùëÜùëòùëò = ùëÖùëÖùëäùëäùëòùëòùë†ùë†ùëòùëò \n(4) Within bucket aggregation: the risk position for delta (respectively vega) bucket b, ùêæùêæùëèùëè, \nmust be determined by aggregating the weighted sensitivities to risk factors within the \nsame bucket using the prescribed correlation ùúåùúåùëòùëòùëòùëò set out in the following formula, where \nthe quantity within the square root function is floored at zero: \nùêæùêæùëèùëè = ÔøΩmax (0, ÔøΩùëäùëäùëÜùëÜùëòùëò\n2\nùëòùëò\n+ ÔøΩÔøΩùúåùúåùëòùëòùëòùëòùëäùëäùëÜùëÜùëòùëòùëäùëäùëÜùëÜùëòùëò\nùëòùëò‚â†ùëòùëòùëòùëò\n) \n(5) Across bucket aggregation: The delta (respectively vega) risk capital requirement is \ncalculated by aggregating the risk positions across the delta (respectively vega) buckets \nwithin each risk class, using the corresponding prescribed correlations ùõæùõæùëèùëèùëèùëè as set out in \nthe following formula, where: \n(a) Sb= ‚àë WSk k for all risk factors in bucket b, and Sc= ‚àë WSk k in bucket c.  \n(b) If these values for Sb and Sc described in above sub paragraph 116(a) produce a \nnegative number for the overall sum of ‚àë ùêæùêæùëèùëè\n2 + ùëèùëè ‚àë ‚àë ùõæùõæùëèùëèùëèùëèùëèùëè‚â†ùëèùëè ùëÜùëÜùëèùëèùëÜùëÜùëèùëèùëèùëè , the institution \nis to calculate the delta (respectively vega) risk capital requirement using an \nalternative specification whereby: \n(i) Sb=max [min (‚àë WSkk ,Kb), ‚àíKb] for all risk factors in bucket b; and \n(ii) Sc=max [min (‚àë WSkk ,Kc), ‚àíKc] for all risk factors in bucket c. \nùê∑ùê∑ùê∑ùê∑ùê∑ùê∑ùê∑ùê∑ùê∑ùê∑ (ùëüùëüùê∑ùê∑ùë†ùë†ùëüùëüùê∑ùê∑ùëüùëüùê∑ùê∑ùëüùëüùëüùëüùê∑ùê∑ùê∑ùê∑ùëüùëü ùëüùëüùê∑ùê∑ùë£ùë£ùê∑ùê∑) = ÔøΩÔøΩùêæùêæùëèùëè\n2\nùëèùëè\n+ ÔøΩÔøΩùõæùõæùëèùëèùëèùëèùëÜùëÜùëèùëèùëÜùëÜùëèùëè\nùëèùëè‚â†ùëèùëèùëèùëè",

For each risk class, to calculate curvature risk capital requirements an institution must \napply an upward shock and a downward shock to each prescribed risk factor and calculate the \nincremental loss for instruments sensitive to that risk factor above that already captured by the \ndelta risk capital requirement using the following step-by-step approach: \n(1) For each instrument sensitive to curvature risk factor k, an upward shock and a downward \nshock must be applied to k. The size of shock (i.e. risk weight) is set out in paragraphs \n210 and 211. \n(a) For example for GIRR, all tenors of all the risk free interest rate curves within a \ngiven currency (e.g. three-month Euribor, six-month Euribor, one year Euribor, \netc. for the euro) must be shifted upward applying the risk weight as set out in \nparagraph 211. The resulting potential loss for each instrument, after the \ndeduction of the delta risk positions, is the outcome of the upward scenario. The \nsame approach must be followed on a downward scenario.  \n(b) If the price of an instrument depends on several risk factors, the curvature risk \nmust be determined separately for each risk factor. \n(2) The net curvature risk capital requirement, determined by the values ùê∂ùê∂ùê∂ùê∂ùëÖùëÖ\nùëòùëò\n+ and ùê∂ùê∂ùê∂ùê∂ùëÖùëÖùëòùëò\n‚àí for \nan institution‚Äôs portfolio for risk factor k described in the above paragraph is calculated \nby the formula below.

Alternatively, the risk-free yield curve should be \nbased on one or more market-implied swap curves used by the institution to mark \npositions to market. For example, interbank offered rate (BOR) swap curves. \n(b) When data on market-implied swap curves described in above (1)(a) are \ninsufficient, the risk-free yield curve may be derived from the most appropriate \nsovereign bond curve for a given currency. In such cases the sensitivities related \nto sovereign bonds are not exempt from the CSR capital requirement: when an \ninstitution cannot perform the decomposition y=r+cs, any sensitivity to y is \nallocated both to the GIRR and to CSR classes as appropriate with the risk factor \nand sensitivity definitions in the standardized approach. Applying swap curves to \nbond-derived sensitivities for GIRR will not change the requirement for basis risk \nto be captured between bond and credit default swap (CDS) curves in the CSR \nclass. \n(c) For the purpose of constructing the risk-free yield curve per currency, an OIS \ncurve (such as Eonia or a new benchmark rate) and a BOR swap curve (such as \nthree-month Euribor or other benchmark rates) must be considered two different \ncurves. Two BOR curves at different maturities (e.g. three-month Euribor and six-\nmonth Euribor) must be considered two different curves. An onshore and an \noffshore currency curve (e.g. onshore Indian rupee and offshore Indian rupee) \nmust be considered two different curves.  \n(2) The GIRR delta risk factors also include a flat curve of market-implied inflation rates for \neach currency with term structure not recognized as a risk factor. \n(a) The sensitivity to the inflation rate from the exposure to implied coupons in an \ninflation instrument gives rise to a specific capital requirement.

DRC \nrequirements provide some limited hedging recognition. In this section offsetting refers to the \nnetting of exposures to the same obligor (where a short exposure may be subtracted in full from a \nlong exposure) and hedging refers to the application of a partial hedge benefit from the short \nexposures (where the risk of long and short exposures in distinct obligors do not fully offset due \nto basis or correlation risks).

This acts as a discount factor that reduces the amount of net short positions to \nbe netted against net long positions within a bucket. A prescribed risk weight is applied to \nthe net positions which are then aggregated. \n(5) Bucket level DRC requirements are aggregated as a simple sum across buckets to give \nthe overall DRC requirement.   \n[Basel Framework, MAR22.3] \n217.

The gross JTD risk position is computed exposure by exposure. For instance, if an \ninstitution has a long position on a bond issued by Apple, and another short position on a bond \nissued by Apple, it must compute two separate JTD exposures. [Basel Framework, MAR22.9] \n222. For the purpose of DRC requirements, the determination of the long/short direction of \npositions must be on the basis of long or short with respect to whether the credit exposure results \nin a loss or gain in the case of a default. \n(1) Specifically, a long exposure is defined as a credit exposure that results in a loss in the \ncase of a default. \n(2) For derivative contracts, the long/short direction is also determined by whether the \ncontract will result in a loss in the case of a default (i.e. long or short position is not \ndetermined by whether the option or credit default swap (CDS), is bought or sold). Thus, \nfor the purpose of DRC requirements, a sold put option on a bond is a long credit \nexposure, since a default results in a loss to the seller of the option.  \n[Basel Framework, MAR22.10] \n223. The gross JTD is a function of the loss given default (LGD), notional amount (or face \nvalue) and the cumulative profit and loss (P&L) already realised on the position, where: \n(1) notional is the bond-equivalent notional amount (or face value) of the position; and \n(2) P&L is the cumulative mark-to-market loss (or gain) already taken on the exposure.

When the offsetting involves decomposing single name equivalent \nexposures, decomposition using a valuation model would be allowed in certain cases as \nfollows. Such decomposition is the sensitivity of the security‚Äôs value to the default of the \nunderlying single name obligor. Decomposition with a valuation model is defined as \nfollows: a single name equivalent constituent of a securitization (e.g. tranched position) is \nthe difference between the unconditional value of the securitization and the conditional \nvalue of the securitization assuming that the single name defaults, with zero recovery, \nwhere the value is determined by a valuation model. In such cases, the decomposition \ninto single-name equivalent exposures must account for the effect of marginal defaults of \nthe single names in the securitization, where in particular the sum of the decomposed \nsingle name amounts must be consistent with the undecomposed value of the \nsecuritization. Further, such decomposition is restricted to vanilla securitizations (e.g. \nvanilla CDOs, index tranches or bespokes); while the decomposition of exotic \nsecuritizations (e.g. CDO squared) is prohibited. \n(3) Moreover, for long and short positions in index tranches, and indices (non-tranched), if \nthe exposures are to the exact same series of the index, then offsetting is allowed by \nreplication and decomposition. For instance, a long securitization exposure in a 10‚Äì15% \ntranche vs combined short securitization exposures in 10‚Äì12% and 12‚Äì15% tranches on \nthe same index/series can be offset against each other. Similarly, long securitization \nexposures in the various tranches that, when combined perfectly, replicate a position in \nthe index series (non-tranched) can be offset against a short securitization exposure in the \nindex series if all the positions are to the exact same index and series (e.g. CDX.NA.IG \nseries 18). Long and short positions in indices and single-name constituents in the index \nmay also be offset by decomposition.

This coverage ratio is \ncalculated as the ratio of the standardized market risk capital requirements of internal model \napproved in-scope desks divided by the standardized market risk capital requirement of all desks \n(including out of scope desks but excluding those portfolios captured in paragraph 50). For \nclarity, only instruments for which the standardized approach must be used by all institutions, as \nspecified in paragraph 50, and their capital contribution should be excluded from the numerator \nand the denominator, along with their respective hedges.

This may include reviewing the appropriateness of \nassumptions of normal distributions and any pricing models. \n(2) Further to the regulatory backtesting programmes, model validation must assess the \nhypothetical P&L (HPL) calculation methodology. \n(3) The institution must use hypothetical portfolios to ensure that internal models are able to \naccount for particular structural features that may arise.

OSFI may compare this loss \ninformation to the level of capital requirements that would result from an institution‚Äôs \ninternal measurement system. For example, the institution may be required to provide \nOSFI with an assessment of how many days of peak day losses would have been covered \nby a given ES estimate. \n(2) Scenarios requiring a simulation by the institution. Institutions should subject their \nportfolios to a series of simulated stress scenarios and provide OSFI with the results. \nThese scenarios could include testing the current portfolio against past periods of \nsignificant disturbance (e.g. the 1987 equity crash, the Exchange Rate Mechanism crises \nof 1992 and 1993, the increase in interest rates in the first quarter of 1994, the 1998 \nRussian financial crisis, the 2000 bursting of the technology stock bubble, the 2007‚Äì08 \nsubprime mortgage crisis, or the 2011‚Äì12 Euro zone crisis) incorporating both the \nsignificant price movements and the sharp reduction in liquidity associated with these \nevents. A second type of scenario would evaluate the sensitivity of the institution‚Äôs \nmarket risk exposure to changes in the assumptions about volatilities and correlations. \nApplying this test would require an evaluation of the historical range of variation for \nvolatilities and correlations and evaluation of the institution‚Äôs current positions against \nthe extreme values of the historical range. Due consideration should be given to the sharp \nvariation that at times has occurred in a matter of days in periods of significant market \ndisturbance. For example, the above-mentioned situations involved correlations within \nrisk factors approaching the extreme values of 1 or ‚Äì1 for several days at the height of the \ndisturbance. \n(3) Institution-developed stress scenarios. In addition to the scenarios prescribed by OSFI \nunder paragraph 288(1), an institution should also develop its own stress tests that it \nidentifies as most adverse based on the characteristics of its portfolio (e.g. problems in a \nkey region of the world combined with a sharp move in oil prices).

A risk factor derived from a combination of \nmodellable risk factors that are mapped to distinct buckets of a given curve/surface is \nmodellable only if this risk factor also passes the RFET. \n(a) Interpolation based on combinations of modellable risk factors should be \nconsistent with mappings used for PLA testing (to determine the RTPL) and \nshould not be based on alternative, and potentially broader, bucketing approaches. \nLikewise, institutions may compress risk factors into a smaller dimension of \northogonal risk factors (e.g. principal components) and/or derive parameters from \nobservations of modellable risk factors, such as in models of stochastic implied \nvolatility, without the parameters being directly observable in the market.  \n(b) Subject to the approval of OSFI, institutions may extrapolate up to a reasonable \ndistance from the closest modellable risk factor. The extrapolation should not rely \nsolely on the closest modellable risk factor but on more than one modellable risk \nfactor. In the event that an institution uses extrapolation, the extrapolation must be \nconsidered in the determination of the RTPL. \n(2) Principle two. The data used must allow the model to pick up both idiosyncratic and \ngeneral market risk. General market risk is the tendency of an instrument‚Äôs value to \nchange with the change in the value of the broader market, as represented by an \nappropriate index or indices. Idiosyncratic risk is the risk associated with a particular \nissuance, including default provisions, maturity and seniority. The data must allow both \ncomponents of market risk to be captured in any market risk model used to determine \ncapital requirements. If the data used in the model do not reflect either idiosyncratic or \ngeneral market risk, the institution must apply an NMRF charge for those aspects that are \nnot adequately captured in its model. \n(3) Principle three. The data used must allow the model to reflect volatility and correlation \nof the risk positions. Institutions must ensure that they do not understate the volatility of \nan asset (e.g. by using inappropriate averaging of data or proxies). Further, institutions \nmust ensure that they accurately reflect the correlation of asset prices, rates across yield \ncurves and/or volatilities within volatility surfaces. Different data sources can provide \ndramatically different volatility and correlation estimates for asset prices. The institution \nshould choose data sources so as to ensure that (i) the data are representative of real price \nobservations; (ii) price volatility is not understated by the choice of data; and \n(iii) correlations are reasonable approximations of correlations among real price \nobservations. Furthermore, any transformations must not understate the volatility arising",

The data used must be reflective of prices observed and/or quoted in the \nmarket. Where data used are not derived from real price observations, the institution must \ndemonstrate that the data used are reasonably representative of real price observations. \nTo that end, the institution must periodically reconcile price data used in a risk model \nwith front office and back office prices. Just as the back office serves to check the \nvalidity of the front office price, risk model prices should be included in the comparison. \nThe comparison of front or back office prices with risk prices should consist of \ncomparisons of risk prices with real price observations, but front office and back office \nprices can be used where real price observations are not widely available. Institutions \nmust document their approaches to deriving risk factors from market prices. \n(5) Principle five. The data used must be updated at a sufficient frequency. A market risk \nmodel may require large amounts of data, and it can be challenging to update such large \ndata sets frequently. Institutions should strive to update their model data as often as \npossible to account for frequent turnover of positions in the trading portfolio and \nchanging market conditions. Institutions should update data at a minimum on a monthly \nbasis, but preferably daily. Additionally, institutions should have a workflow process for \nupdating the sources of data. Furthermore, where the institution uses regressions to \nestimate risk factor parameters, these must be re-estimated on a regular basis, generally \nno less frequently than every two weeks. Calibration of pricing models to current market \nprices must also be sufficiently frequent, ideally no less frequent than the calibration of \nfront office pricing models. Where appropriate, institutions should have clear policies for \nbackfilling and/or gap-filling missing data. \n(6) Principle six. The data used to determine stressed expected shortfall (ES\nR,S) must be \nreflective of market prices observed and/or quoted in the period of stress. The data for the \nES\nR,S model should be sourced directly from the historical period whenever possible. \nThere are cases where the characteristics of current instruments in the market differ from \nthose in the stress period. Nevertheless, institutions must empirically justify any instances \nwhere the market prices used for the stress period are different from the market prices \nactually observed during that period. Further, in cases where instruments that are \ncurrently traded did not exist during a period of significant financial stress, institutions \nmust demonstrate that the prices used match changes in prices or spreads of similar \ninstruments during the stress period. \n(a) In cases where institutions do not sufficiently justify the use of current market \ndata for products whose characteristics have changed since the stress period, the \ninstitution must omit the risk factor for the stressed period and meet the \nrequirement of paragraph 365(2)(b) that the reduced set of risk factors explain \n75% of the fully specified ES model. Moreover, if name-specific risk factors are \nused to calculate the ES in the actual period and these names were not available in \nthe stressed period, there is a presumption that the idiosyncratic part of these risk \nfactors are not in the reduced set of risk factors. Exposures for risk factors that are \nincluded in the current set but not in the reduced set need to be mapped to the \nmost suitable risk factor of the reduced set for the purposes of calculating ES \nmeasures in the stressed period.",

The use of proxies must be limited, and proxies must have sufficiently \nsimilar characteristics to the transactions they represent. Proxies must be appropriate for \nthe region, quality and type of instrument they are intended to represent. OSFI will assess \nwhether methods for combining risk factors are conceptually and empirically sound.  \n(a) For example, the use of indices in a multifactor model must capture the correlated \nrisk of the assets represented by the indices, and the remaining idiosyncratic risk \nmust be demonstrably uncorrelated across different issuers. A multifactor model \nmust have significant explanatory power for the price movements of assets and \nmust provide an assessment of the uncertainty in the final outcome due to the use \nof a proxy. The coefficients (betas) of a multifactor model must be empirically \nbased and must not be determined based on judgment.

The institution‚Äôs \naggregated market risk capital requirement must be based on positions held in trading desks that \nqualify for use of the institution‚Äôs internal models for market risk capital requirements by \nsatisfying the backtesting and PLA test as set out in this section. This criterion must be assessed \nby the institution on a quarterly basis when calculating the aggregate capital requirement for \nmarket risk according to paragraph 403.

Backtesting requirements compare the value-at-risk (VaR) measure calibrated to a one-\nday holding period against each of the actual P&L (APL) and hypothetical P&L (HPL) over the \nprior 12 months. Specific requirements to be applied at the institution-wide level and trading \ndesk level are set out below. [Basel Framework, MAR32.4] \n320. Backtesting of the institution-wide risk model must be based on a VaR measure \ncalibrated at a 99\nth percentile confidence level.  \n(1) An exception or an outlier occurs when either the actual loss or the hypothetical loss of \nthe institution-wide trading book registered in a day of the backtesting period exceeds the \ncorresponding daily VaR measure given by the model. As per paragraph 414, exceptions \nfor actual losses are counted separately from exceptions for hypothetical losses; the \noverall number of exceptions is the greater of these two amounts. \n(2) In the event either the P&L or the daily VaR measure is not available or impossible to \ncompute, it will count as an outlier. \n[Basel Framework, MAR32.5] \n321. In the event an outlier can be shown by the institution to relate to a non-modellable risk \nfactor, and the capital requirement for that non-modellable risk factor exceeds the actual or \nhypothetical loss for that day, it may be disregarded for the purpose of the overall backtesting \nprocess if OSFI is notified accordingly and does not object to this treatment. In these cases, an \ninstitution must document the history of the movement of the value of the relevant non-\nmodellable risk factor and have supporting evidence that the non-modellable risk factor has \ncaused the relevant loss. \nIf the backtesting exception at a desk-level test is being driven by a non-modellable risk factor \nthat receives an SES capital requirement that is in excess of the maximum of the APL loss or \nHPL loss for that day, it is permitted to be disregarded for the purposes of the desk-level \nbacktesting.

Adjustments to RTPL input data will be allowed when the input data for a given risk \nfactor that is included in both the RTPL and the HPL differs due to different providers of market \ndata sources or time fixing of market data sources, or transformations of market data into input \ndata suitable for the risk factors of the underlying pricing models. These adjustments can be done \neither: \n(1) by direct replacement of the RTPL input data (e.g. par rate tenor x, provider a) with the \nHPL input data (e.g. par rate tenor x, provider b); or \n(2) by using the HPL input data (e.g. par rate tenor x, provider b) as a basis to calculate the \nrisk factor data needed in the RTPL/ES model (e.g. zero rate tenor x). \nIn the event trading desks of an institution operate in different time zones compared to the \nlocation of the institution‚Äôs risk control department, the institution is permitted to align the \nsnapshot time used for the calculation of the RTPL of a desk to the snapshot time used for the \nderivation of its HPL.

If the HPL uses market data in a different manner to RTPL to calculate risk parameters \nthat are essential to the valuation engine, these differences must be reflected in the PLA test and \nas a result in the calculation of HPL and RTPL. In this regard, HPL and RTPL are allowed to use \nthe same market data only as a basis, but must use their respective methods (which can differ) to \ncalculate the respective valuation engine parameters. This would be the case, for example, where \nmarket data are transformed as part of the valuation process used to calculate RTPL. In that \ninstance, institutions may align market data between RTPL and HPL pre-transformation but not \npost-transformation. [Basel Framework, MAR32.32] \n348. Institutions are not permitted to align HPL input data for risk factors with input data used \nin RTPL. Adjustments to RTPL or HPL to address residual operational noise are not permitted. \nResidual operational noise arises from computing HPL and RTPL in two different systems at two \ndifferent points in time.

All other \nequity repo and dividend risk factors are subject to a liquidity horizon of 60 days. \nFor mono-currency and cross-currency basis risk, liquidity horizons of 10 days and 20 days for \ninterest rate-specified currencies and unspecified currencies, respectively, should be applied. \nThe liquidity horizon for inflation risk factors should be consistent with the liquidity horizons for \ninterest rate risk factors for a given currency. \nIf the maturity of the instrument is shorter than the respective liquidity horizon of the risk factor \nas prescribed in paragraph 372, the next longer liquidity horizon length (out of the lengths of 10, \n20, 40, 60 or 120 days as set out in the paragraph) compared with the maturity of the instrument \nitself must be used. For example, although the liquidity horizon for interest rate volatility is \nprescribed as 60 days, if an instrument matures in 30 days, a 40-day liquidity horizon would \napply for the instrument‚Äôs interest rate volatility. \nTo determine the liquidity horizon of multi-sector credit and equity indices, the respective \nliquidity horizons of the underlying instruments must be used. A weighted average of liquidity \nhorizons of the instruments contained in the index must be determined by multiplying the \nliquidity horizon of each individual instrument by its weight in the index (i.e. the weight used to \nconstruct the index) and summing across all instruments. The liquidity horizon of the index is the \nshortest liquidity horizon (out of 10, 20, 40, 60 and 120 days) that is equal to or longer than the \nweighted average liquidity horizon. For example, if the weighted average liquidity horizon is 12 \ndays, the liquidity horizon of the index would be 20 days. \n[Basel Framework, MAR33.12] \n9.6.4.2  Calculation of Capital Requirement for Modellable Risk Factors \n373.

The \ninstitution must calculate its internally modelled capital requirement at the institution-wide level \nusing this model, with no supervisory constraints on cross-risk class correlations (IMCC(C)).  \nInstitutions design their own models for use under the IMA. As a result, they may exclude risk \nfactors from IMA models as long as OSFI does not conclude that the risk factor must be \ncapitalised by either ES or SES. Moreover, at a minimum, the risk factors defined in paragraphs \n289 to 300 need to be covered in the IMA.

The institution must calculate a series of partial ES capital requirements (i.e. all other risk \nfactors must be held constant) for the range of broad regulatory risk classes (interest rate risk, \nequity risk, foreign exchange risk, commodity risk and credit spread risk). These partial, non-\ndiversifiable (constrained) ES values (IMCC(C\ni)) will then be summed to provide an aggregated \nrisk class ES capital requirement. [Basel Framework, MAR33.14] \n375.

Institutions must have a separate internal model to measure the default risk of trading \nbook positions. The general criteria in paragraphs 266 to 269 and the qualitative standards in \nparagraphs 270 to 281 also apply to the default risk model. [Basel Framework, MAR33.18] \n379. Default risk is the risk of direct loss due to an obligor‚Äôs default as well as the potential for \nindirect losses that may arise from a default event. [Basel Framework, MAR33.19] \n380. Default risk must be measured using a value-at-risk (VaR) model.  \n(1) Institutions must use a default simulation model with two types of systematic risk factors. \nThe model should always have two random variables that correspond to the systematic \nrisk factors. \nSystematic risk in a DRC requirement model must be accounted for via multiple \nsystematic factors of two different types. The random variable that determines whether an \nobligor defaults must be an obligor-specific function of the systematic factors of both \ntypes and of an idiosyncratic factor. For example, in a Merton-type model, obligor i \ndefaults when its asset return X\ni falls below an obligor-specific threshold that determines \nthe obligor‚Äôs probability of default. Systematic risk can be described via M systematic \nregional factors Yj\nregion (j = 1, ‚Ä¶ , M) and N systematic industry factors Yj\nindustry (j =\n1, ‚Ä¶ , N). For each obligor i, region factor loadings Œ≤i,j\nregion and industry factor loadings \nŒ≤i,j\nindustry that describe the sensitivity of the obligor‚Äôs asset return to each systematic \nfactor need to be chosen. There must be at least one non-zero factor loading for the \nregion type and at least one non-zero factor loading for the industry type.

No additional data sources (e.g. rating time \nseries) are permitted. \n(3) Institutions must have clear policies and procedures that describe the correlation \ncalibration process, documenting in particular in which cases credit spreads or equity \nprices are used.  \n(4) Institutions have the discretion to apply a minimum liquidity horizon of 60 days to the \ndetermination of default risk capital (DRC) requirement for equity sub-portfolios.  \nInstitutions are permitted to calibrate correlations to liquidity horizons of 60 days in the \ncase that a separate calculation is performed for equity sub-portfolios and these desks \ndeal predominately in equity exposures.

[Basel Framework, \nMAR33.46] \n9.6.5 GUIDANCE ON USE OF THE INTERNAL MODELS APPROACH \nThis section sets out application guidance for backtesting requirements and principles for risk \nfactor modellability under the internal models approach. \n9.6.5.1  Trading Desk-Level Backtesting \n407. An additional consideration in specifying the appropriate risk measures and trading \noutcomes for profit and loss (P&L) attribution test and backtesting arises because the internally \nmodelled risk measurement is generally based on the sensitivity of a static portfolio to \ninstantaneous price shocks. That is, end-of-day trading positions are input into the risk \nmeasurement model, which assesses the possible change in the value of this static portfolio due \nto price and rate movements over the assumed holding period. [Basel Framework, MAR99.1] \n408. While this is straightforward in theory, in practice it complicates the issue of backtesting. \nFor instance, it is often argued that neither expected shortfall nor value-at-risk measures can be \ncompared against actual trading outcomes, since the actual outcomes will reflect changes in \nportfolio composition during the holding period. According to this view, the inclusion of fee \nincome together with trading gains and losses resulting from changes in the composition of the \nportfolio should not be included in the definition of the trading outcome because they do not \nrelate to the risk inherent in the static portfolio that was assumed in constructing the value-at-risk \nmeasure. [Basel Framework, MAR99.2] \n409. This argument is persuasive with regard to the use of risk measures based on price shocks \ncalibrated to longer holding periods. That is, comparing the liquidity-adjusted time horizon 99\nth \npercentile risk measures from the internal models capital requirement with actual liquidity-\nadjusted time horizon trading outcomes would probably not be a meaningful exercise. In \nparticular, in any given multi-day period, significant changes in portfolio composition relative to \nthe initial positions are common at major trading institutions. For this reason, the backtesting \nframework described here involves the use of risk measures calibrated to a one-day holding \nperiod. Other than the restrictions mentioned in this paper, the test would be based on how \ninstitutions model risk internally. [Basel Framework, MAR99.3] \n410. Given the use of one-day risk measures, it is appropriate to employ one-day trading \noutcomes as the benchmark to use in the backtesting programme. The same concerns about \n‚Äúcontamination‚Äù of the trading outcomes discussed above continue to be relevant, however, even \nfor one-day trading outcomes. That is, there is a concern that the overall one-day trading",

[Basel \nFramework, MAR99.4] \n411. On the one hand, intraday trading will tend to increase the volatility of trading outcomes \nand may result in cases where the overall trading outcome exceeds the risk measure. This event \nclearly does not imply a problem with the methods used to calculate the risk measure; rather, it is \nsimply outside the scope of what the measure is intended to capture. On the other hand, including \nfee income may similarly distort the backtest, but in the other direction, since fee income often \nhas annuity-like characteristics. Since this fee income is not typically included in the calculation \nof the risk measure, problems with the risk measurement model could be masked by including \nfee income in the definition of the trading outcome used for backtesting purposes. [Basel \nFramework, MAR99.5] \n412. To the extent that backtesting programmes are viewed purely as a statistical test of the \nintegrity of the calculation of the risk measures, it is appropriate to employ a definition of daily \ntrading outcome that allows for an uncontaminated test. To meet this standard, institutions must \nhave the capability to perform the tests based on the hypothetical changes in portfolio value that \nwould occur were end-of-day positions to remain unchanged. [Basel Framework, MAR99.6] \n413. Backtesting using actual daily P&Ls is also a useful exercise since it can uncover cases \nwhere the risk measures are not accurately capturing trading volatility in spite of being calculated \nwith integrity. [Basel Framework, MAR99.7] \n414. For these reasons, OSFI requires institutions to develop the capability to perform these \ntests using both hypothetical and actual trading outcomes. In combination, the two approaches \nare likely to provide a strong understanding of the relation between calculated risk measures and \ntrading outcomes. The total number of backtesting exceptions for the purpose of the thresholds in \nparagraph 324 must be calculated as the maximum of the exceptions generated under \nhypothetical or actual trading outcomes. [Basel Framework, MAR99.8] \n9.6.5.2  Institution-Wide Backtesting \nStatistical considerations in defining the backtesting zones \n415. To place the definitions of three zones of the institution-wide backtesting in proper \nperspective, however, it is useful to examine the probabilities of obtaining various numbers of \nexceptions under different assumptions about the accuracy of an institution‚Äôs risk measurement \nmodel. [Basel Framework, MAR99.9] \n416. Three zones have been delineated and their boundaries chosen in order to balance two \ntypes of statistical error:  \n(1) the possibility that an accurate risk model would be classified as inaccurate on the basis \nof its backtesting result, and  \n(2) the possibility that an inaccurate model would not be classified that way based on its \nbacktesting result.",

For each inaccurate \nmodel, the exact column reports the probability of obtaining exactly the number of exceptions shown under this assumption in a \nsample of 250 independent observations. The type 2 columns report the probability that using a given number of exceptions as \nthe cut-off for rejecting a model will imply erroneous acceptance of an inaccurate model with the assumed level of coverage \nusing a sample of 250 independent observations. For example, if the cut-off level is set at five or more exceptions, the type 2 \ncolumn for an assumed coverage level of 97% reports the probability of falsely accepting a model with only 97% coverage with \n250 independent observations is 12.8%. \n[Basel Framework, MAR99.11] \n418. The right-hand portion of the table reports probabilities associated with several possible \ninaccurate models, namely models whose true levels of coverage are 98%, 97%, 96%, and 95%, \nrespectively. Thus, the column labelled ‚Äúexact‚Äù under an assumed coverage level of 97% shows \nthat five exceptions would then be expected in 10.9% of the samples. [Basel Framework, \nMAR99.12] \n419.

For example, if the \nthreshold is set as low as one exception, then accurate models will be rejected fully 91.9% of the \ntime, because they will escape rejection only in the 8.1% of cases where they generate zero \nexceptions. As the threshold number of exceptions is increased, the probability of making this \ntype of error declines. [Basel Framework, MAR99.13] \n420. Under the assumptions that the model‚Äôs true level of coverage is not 99%, the table \nreports the probability that selecting a given number of exceptions as a threshold for rejecting the \naccuracy of the model will result in an erroneous acceptance of a model with the assumed \n(inaccurate) level of coverage (type 2 error). For example, if the model‚Äôs actual level of coverage \nis 97%, and the threshold for rejection is set at seven or more exceptions, the table indicates that \nthis model would be erroneously accepted 37.5% of the time. [Basel Framework, MAR99.14] \n421. The results in Table 21 also demonstrate some of the statistical limitations of backtesting. \nIn particular, there is no threshold number of exceptions that yields both a low probability of \nerroneously rejecting an accurate model and a low probability of erroneously accepting all of the \nrelevant inaccurate models. It is for this reason that OSFI has rejected an approach that contains \nonly a single threshold. [Basel Framework, MAR99.15] \n422. Given these limitations, OSFI has classified outcomes for the backtesting of the \ninstitution-wide model into three categories. In the first category, the test results are consistent \nwith an accurate model, and the possibility of erroneously accepting an inaccurate model is low \n(i.e. backtesting ‚Äúgreen zone‚Äù). At the other extreme, the test results are extremely unlikely to \nhave resulted from an accurate model, and the probability of erroneously rejecting an accurate \nmodel on this basis is remote (i.e. backtesting ‚Äúred zone‚Äù). In between these two cases, however, \nis a zone where the backtesting results could be consistent with either accurate or inaccurate \nmodels, and OSFI will encourage an institution to present additional information about its model \nbefore taking action (i.e. backtesting ‚Äùamber zone‚Äù). [Basel Framework, MAR99.16] \n423. Table 22 sets out the OSFI‚Äôs agreed boundaries for these zones and the presumptive OSFI \nresponse for each backtesting outcome, based on a sample of 250 observations. For other sample \nsizes, the boundaries should be deduced by calculating the binomial probabilities associated with \ntrue coverage of 99%, as in Table 21. The backtesting amber zone begins at the point such that \nthe probability of obtaining that number or fewer exceptions equals or exceeds 95%. Table 22 \nreports these cumulative probabilities for each number of exceptions. For 250 observations, it \ncan be seen that five or fewer exceptions will be obtained 95.88% of the time when the true level \nof coverage is 99%. Thus, the backtesting amber zone begins at five exceptions. Similarly, the \nbeginning of the backtesting red zone is defined as the point such that the probability of \nobtaining that number or fewer exceptions equals or exceeds 99.99%. Table 22 shows that for a \nsample of 250 observations and a true coverage level of 99%, this occurs with 10 exceptions.",

For other sample sizes, the amber zone begins at the point where the cumulative probability equals or \nexceeds 95%, and the red zone begins at the point where the cumulative probability equals or exceeds 99.99%. \nThe cumulative probability is simply the probability of obtaining a given number or fewer exceptions in a sample of 250 \nobservations when the true coverage level is 99%. For example, the cumulative probability shown for four exceptions is the \nprobability of obtaining between zero and four exceptions. \nNote that these cumulative probabilities and the type 1 error probabilities reported in Table 21 do not sum to one because the \ncumulative probability for a given number of exceptions includes the possibility of obtaining exactly that number of exceptions, \nas does the type 1 error probability. Thus, the sum of these two probabilities exceeds one by the amount of the probability of \nobtaining exactly that number of exceptions. \n[Basel Framework, MAR99.17] \n424. The backtesting green zone needs little explanation. Since a model that truly provides \n99% coverage would be quite likely to produce as many as four exceptions in a sample of 250 \noutcomes, there is little reason for concern raised by backtesting results that fall in this range. \nThis is reinforced by the results in Table 21, which indicate that accepting outcomes in this range \nleads to only a small chance of erroneously accepting an inaccurate model. [Basel Framework, \nMAR99.18] \n425. The range from five to nine exceptions constitutes the backtesting amber zone. Outcomes \nin this range are plausible for both accurate and inaccurate models, although Table 21 suggests \nthat they are generally more likely for inaccurate models than for accurate models. Moreover, the \nresults in Table 21 indicate that the presumption that the model is inaccurate should grow as the \nnumber of exceptions increases in the range from five to nine.

Table 22 sets out the OSFI‚Äôs agreed guidelines for increases in the multiplication factor \napplicable to the internal models capital requirement, resulting from backtesting results in the \nbacktesting amber zone. [Basel Framework, MAR99.20] \n427. These particular values reflect the general idea that the increase in the multiplication \nfactor should be sufficient to return the model to a 99th percentile standard. For example, five \nexceptions in a sample of 250 imply only 98% coverage. Thus, the increase in the multiplication \nfactor should be sufficient to transform a model with 98% coverage into one with 99% coverage. \nNeedless to say, precise calculations of this sort require additional statistical assumptions that are \nnot likely to hold in all cases. For example, if the distribution of trading outcomes is assumed to \nbe normal, then the ratio of the 99th percentile to the 98th percentile is approximately 1.14, and \nthe increase needed in the multiplication factor is therefore approximately 1.13 for a multiplier of \n1. If the actual distribution is not normal, but instead has ‚Äúfat tails‚Äù, then larger increases may be \nrequired to reach the 99\nth percentile standard. The concern about fat tails was also an important \nfactor in the choice of the specific increments set out in Table 22. [Basel Framework, \nMAR99.21] \n9.6.5.3  Examples of the Application of the Principles for Risk Factor Modellability \n428. Although OSFI may use discretion regarding the types of evidence required of \ninstitutions to provide risk factor modellability, the following are examples of the types of \nevidence that institutions may be required to provide. \n(1) Regression diagnostics for multi-factor beta models. In addition to showing that indices or \nother regressors are appropriate for the region, asset class and credit quality (if \napplicable) of an instrument, institutions must be prepared to demonstrate that the \ncoefficients used in multi-factor models are adequate to capture both general market risk \nand idiosyncratic risk. If the institution assumes that the residuals from the multi-factor \nmodel are uncorrelated with each other, the institution should be prepared to demonstrate \nthat the modellable residuals are uncorrelated. Further, the factors in the multi-factor \nmodel must be appropriate for the region and asset class of the instrument and must \nexplain the general market risk of the instrument. This must be demonstrated through \ngoodness-of-fit statistics (e.g. an adjusted-R2 coefficient) and other diagnostics on the \ncoefficients. Most importantly, where the estimated coefficients are not used (i.e. the \nparameters are judgment-based), the institution must describe how the coefficients are \nchosen and why they cannot be estimated, and demonstrate that the choice does not \nunderestimate risk. In general, risk factors are not considered modellable in cases where \nparameters are set by judgment. \n(2) Recovery of price from risk factors. The institution must periodically demonstrate and \ndocument that the risk factors used in its risk model can be fed into front office pricing \nmodels and recover the actual prices of the assets. If the recovered prices substantially \ndeviate from the actual prices, this can indicate a problem with prices used to derive the \nrisk factors and call into question the validity of data inputs for risk purposes. In such \ncases, OSFI may determine that the risk factor is non-modellable. \n(3) Risk pricing is periodically reconciled with front office and back office prices.

Results of these reconciliations should be made available to OSFI, including \nstatistics on the differences of the risk price from front office and back office prices. It is \nstandard practice for institutions to conduct reconciliation of front office and back office \nprices; the risk prices must be included as part of the reconciliation of the front office and \nwhenever there is a potential for discrepancy. If the discrepancy is large, OSFI may \ndetermine that the risk factor is non-modellable. \n(4) Risk factors generated from parameterised models. For options, implied volatility \nsurfaces are often built using a parameterised model based on single-name underlyings \nand/or option index RPOs and/or market quotes. Liquid options at moneyness, tenor and \noption expiry points may be used to calibrate level, volatility, drift and correlation \nparameters for a single-name or benchmark volatility surface. Once these parameters are \nset, they are derived risk factors in their own right that must be updated and recalibrated \nperiodically as new data arrive and trades occur. In the event that these risk factors are \nused to proxy for other single-name option surface points, there must be an additional-\nbasis non-modellable risk factor overlay for any potential deviations. \n[Basel Framework, MAR99.22]",
