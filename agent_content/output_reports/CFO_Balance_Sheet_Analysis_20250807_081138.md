## Wrong-Way Risk: A Detailed Report

This report details wrong-way risk and its calculation, focusing on its implications for financial institutions, particularly in the context of counterparty credit risk (CCR).

### What is Wrong-Way Risk?

Wrong-way risk refers to the situation where the exposure to a counterparty increases as the counterparty's creditworthiness deteriorates, exacerbating potential losses in the event of default.  This positive correlation between exposure and probability of default amplifies the overall risk.  Two types of wrong-way risk are recognized:

* **General Wrong-Way Risk:**  This arises when the probability of counterparty defaults is positively correlated with general market risk factors.  For example, during an economic downturn, both the likelihood of defaults and the exposure to counterparties might increase.  "[Institutions] must identify exposures that give rise to a greater degree of general wrong-way risk. Stress testing and scenario analyses must be designed to identify risk factors that are positively correlated with counterparty credit worthiness." (Settlement and Counterparty Risk, Page 25, Paragraph 64)

* **Specific Wrong-Way Risk (SWWR):** This occurs when the future exposure to a *specific* counterparty is highly correlated with *that counterparty's* probability of default due to the nature of the transactions.  A classic example is a company writing put options on its own stock. If the company's financial health declines, the value of the put options (and thus the exposure to the option buyer) increases, while simultaneously the probability of the company (the option writer) defaulting also increases. "[An institution] is exposed to 'specific wrong-way risk' (SWWR) if future exposure to a specific counterparty is highly correlated with the counterparty’s probability of default." (Settlement and Counterparty Risk, Page 25, Paragraph 65)

### How is Wrong-Way Risk Calculated?

The calculation of wrong-way risk, particularly SWWR, is integrated into the broader calculation of CCR exposure, specifically the Exposure at Default (EAD).  There are two primary methods for calculating EAD:

**1. Internal Model Method (IMM):**

* This method allows institutions, with supervisory approval, to use their own internal models to estimate EAD.  The model must explicitly account for the potential increase in exposure due to wrong-way risk.
* The IMM calculates EAD as the product of alpha (α) and Effective Expected Positive Exposure (Effective EPE): EAD = α × Effective EPE (Settlement and Counterparty Risk, Page 14, Paragraph 26).  Alpha is a multiplier set at 1.4, but can be higher based on the institution's risk profile, including wrong-way risk exposures. (Settlement and Counterparty Risk, Page 15, Paragraph 30)
* For SWWR, specific adjustments are made: "To calculate the CCR capital charge, the instruments for which there exists a legal connection between the counterparty and the underlying issuer, and for which specific wrong way risk has been identified, are not considered to be in the same netting set as other transactions with the counterparty." (Settlement and Counterparty Risk, Page 25, Paragraph 65)  This effectively isolates the SWWR exposures and prevents their netting with other less risky exposures.  Further, for certain single-name credit default swaps and other derivatives with SWWR, the EAD is calculated assuming a jump-to-default of the underlying security or a full loss on the underlying instrument. (Settlement and Counterparty Risk, Page 25, Paragraph 65)

**2. Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR):**

* For institutions without IMM approval, the SA-CCR provides a standardized method for calculating EAD.  While the SA-CCR doesn't explicitly calculate a separate wrong-way risk charge, it incorporates the impact of SWWR through similar adjustments as in the IMM.
*  "The requirements for trades where SWWR... has been identified... also apply to trades where the exposure is measured using the SACCR." (Settlement and Counterparty Risk, Page 56, Paragraph 169)  This means that transactions with identified SWWR are treated as separate netting sets, preventing offsetting with other transactions. (Settlement and Counterparty Risk, Page 25, Paragraph 65)

**Mitigating Wrong-Way Risk:**

The capital impact of SWWR can be mitigated through:

* **Prepayment:** If the counterparty prepays the notional amount of the SWWR exposure, the EAD can be reduced accordingly. (Settlement and Counterparty Risk, Page 26, Paragraph 65)
* **Independent Collateral:**  If independent collateral is specifically pledged to cover the SWWR trade or agreed upon by both parties to cover the SWWR, the EAD can be reduced by the collateral amount (after haircuts). (Settlement and Counterparty Risk, Page 26, Paragraph 65)


This initial response provides a general overview of wrong-way risk and its calculation.  Further refinement is possible with additional context or specific scenarios.
