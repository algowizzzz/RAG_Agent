## Wrong-Way Risk: Definition and Calculation

The provided financial documents do not contain information about "wrong-way risk."  Therefore, I cannot calculate it based on the given data. However, I can provide a definition and explanation of the concept, along with examples and how it's generally assessed.

**What is Wrong-Way Risk?**

Wrong-way risk refers to the situation where the exposure to a counterparty increases at the same time as the counterparty's creditworthiness deteriorates.  This creates a double negative impact: not only is the counterparty less likely to fulfill its obligations, but the amount owed has also increased.  This is most relevant in the context of derivative transactions.

**Contrast with Right-Way Risk:**

The opposite of wrong-way risk is *right-way risk*. This occurs when the exposure to a counterparty *decreases* as their creditworthiness deteriorates.

**Examples of Wrong-Way Risk:**

* **A company buys a large amount of foreign currency forward from a bank in that foreign country.** If the foreign country's economy weakens, the company's exposure to the bank increases (as the foreign currency depreciates, making the forward more valuable to the company), while simultaneously the bank's creditworthiness is likely to decline.
* **A company enters into an interest rate swap with a bank where the company receives a fixed rate and pays a floating rate.** If interest rates rise significantly, the company's exposure to the bank increases (as the fixed rate it receives becomes more valuable), while the bank might experience financial stress due to the higher interest rate environment.

**Calculating and Assessing Wrong-Way Risk:**

Calculating wrong-way risk precisely is complex and requires detailed information about the counterparty's creditworthiness and the specific terms of the derivative contract.  It often involves sophisticated modeling techniques.  However, a qualitative assessment can be performed by considering the following factors:

* **Correlation between counterparty creditworthiness and exposure:**  Is there a positive correlation (wrong-way risk) or a negative correlation (right-way risk)?
* **Magnitude of potential exposure:** What is the maximum possible loss if the counterparty defaults?
* **Counterparty's credit rating and financial health:**  What is the likelihood of the counterparty defaulting?
* **Terms of the derivative contract:**  Do the terms of the contract exacerbate or mitigate the wrong-way risk?

**Information Needed for Calculation:**

To calculate wrong-way risk, one would need information not present in the provided financial statements. This includes:

* **Details of any derivative transactions:**  The provided data only shows basic financial statements (Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement) for TechTrend, and general business data for another unnamed company.  There is no information about derivative positions.
* **Counterparty credit information:**  Credit ratings, financial statements, and other relevant information about the counterparties to any derivative transactions would be needed.
* **Market data:**  Information about relevant market variables (e.g., interest rates, exchange rates, commodity prices) is necessary to model the potential exposure.


Since the provided documents are standard financial statements and don't contain information about derivative exposures or counterparty credit risk, a wrong-way risk calculation is not possible.  Further information is required to perform such an analysis.
