#### ðŸ¤– Regulatory Guidance

Here's a breakdown of the definition of default and its capital treatment according to OSFI, based on the provided document:

**1. Analysis of the Question:**

The question asks for the definition of default and how capital is treated for defaulted exposures. This falls under credit risk within the CAR guidelines, specifically focusing on the Standardized Approach for credit risk.

**2. Retrieval of Relevant Context:**

The provided text excerpt comes from the "Banks/BHC/T&L Credit Risk-Standardized Approach" document, Chapter 4 (October 2023).  Paragraphs 140-144 are particularly relevant.

**3. Evaluation of Retrieved Information:**

The retrieved information directly addresses both parts of the question: the definition of a defaulted exposure and the risk-weighting applied to such exposures.  It also distinguishes between general and retail exposures and provides specific risk weights.

**4. Synthesized Response with Regulatory References:**

**Definition of Default (Paragraph 140):**

A defaulted exposure is defined as one that meets either of these criteria:

* **Past Due:** More than 90 days past due.
* **Defaulted Borrower:**  A borrower is considered defaulted if *any* of the following events have occurred:
    * Material credit obligation past due > 90 days (overdrafts included if limits are breached).
    * Material credit obligation is on non-accrued status (e.g., interest income no longer recognized).
    * Write-off or specific provision due to perceived credit quality decline.
    * Credit obligation sold at a material credit-related economic loss.
    * Distressed restructuring of a credit obligation (e.g., forgiveness or postponement of principal/interest).
    * Borrower's bankruptcy or similar order filed.
    * Borrower seeking bankruptcy protection to avoid/delay repayment.
    * Any other situation where full repayment without recourse to security is unlikely.

**Retail Exposures (Paragraph 141):**

For retail exposures, the default definition can be applied at the individual credit obligation level, rather than at the borrower level.  A default on one obligation doesn't automatically trigger default status for all other obligations.

**Capital Treatment/Risk Weighting of Defaulted Exposures (Paragraphs 142-144):**

* **General Case (Paragraph 142):**  Excluding residential real estate exposures covered in the next point, the unsecured/unguaranteed portion of a defaulted exposure is risk-weighted (net of specific provisions and partial write-offs) as follows:
    * **150%:** When specific provisions are < 20% of the outstanding loan amount.
    * **100%:** When specific provisions are â‰¥ 20% of the outstanding loan amount.

* **Residential Real Estate Exposures (Paragraph 143):** Defaulted residential real estate exposures where repayments don't materially depend on property cash flows are risk-weighted at 100% (net of provisions and write-offs). Eligible guarantees or collateral can be considered for credit risk mitigation.

* **Secured/Guaranteed Portion (Paragraph 144):** Eligible collateral and guarantees for determining the secured/guaranteed portion are the same as those used for credit risk mitigation purposes (refer to Section 4.3 of the document, not included in this excerpt).

**Additional Notes:**

This information is for general guidance only.  For specific implementation and to ensure full compliance with OSFI regulations, consulting with a qualified financial professional is strongly recommended.  The full OSFI guidelines should always be consulted for complete and up-to-date information.

### Question 2

**Query:** *What is the minimum Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio requirement?*

#### ðŸ§  Agent Reasoning Process

#### ðŸ“Š Reasoning Summary

- **Total Steps:** 14
- **Step Types:** retrieval, synthesis, evaluation, analysis, tool_call, conclusion, decision
- **Analysis Time:** 2025-08-05T21:23:00.225039

#### ðŸ¤– Regulatory Guidance

1. **Analyze the question:** The user is asking about the minimum Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio requirement. This falls under the OSFI CAR guidelines, specifically concerning capital adequacy requirements.

2. **Retrieve relevant context:** I used the following query to retrieve information from the OSFI CAR documents: "minimum CET1 capital ratio requirement".

3. **Evaluate retrieved information:** The retrieved information contains sections from various chapters of the OSFI guidelines, including discussions of CET1 components, calculations, and minimum requirements.  The most relevant information pertains to Table 2 in Chapter 1 of the "Banks/BHC/T&L Overview of risk-based capital requirements".

4. **Synthesize a comprehensive response:**  The minimum CET1 capital ratio requirement is 4.5% of risk-weighted assets (RWA). This is the minimum level of CET1 capital that a bank must maintain to meet regulatory requirements.  This is outlined in Table 2 of Chapter 1 of the *Banks/BHC/T&L Overview of risk-based capital requirements* document.  It's important to note that this is a minimum requirement, and banks may be required to hold additional capital buffers (e.g., capital conservation buffer, countercyclical buffer).  For further details on these additional buffers, please refer to section 1.7 of the same document.  Additionally, specific requirements may vary depending on the specific category of the institution. For example, Category III SMSBs have specific requirements outlined in section 1.6.2 of the same document.  For implementation and specific application to your institution, it is recommended to consult with a qualified professional to ensure compliance with all applicable regulations.

### Question 3

**Query:** *How do you calculate risk-weighted assets for credit risk?*

#### ðŸ§  Agent Reasoning Process

#### ðŸ“Š Reasoning Summary

- **Total Steps:** 14
- **Step Types:** retrieval, synthesis, evaluation, analysis, tool_call, conclusion, decision
- **Analysis Time:** 2025-08-05T21:23:24.322237

#### ðŸ¤– Regulatory Guidance

1. **Analyze the question:** The user wants to know how risk-weighted assets (RWA) are calculated for credit risk.

2. **Retrieve relevant context:** I used the following query to retrieve information from the OSFI CAR documents: "risk-weighted assets for credit risk calculation"

3. **Evaluate retrieved information:** The retrieved information provides an overview of RWA calculation for credit risk, including different approaches and specific cases. It covers the standardized approach, IRB approach, and specific asset classes like purchased receivables.  It also references relevant chapters for more details.

4. **Synthesize a comprehensive response:**

Risk-weighted assets (RWA) for credit risk are a crucial component of the capital adequacy ratio calculation.  They represent the amount of capital a bank needs to hold against its credit exposures, adjusted for risk.  The calculation method depends on the approach used:

* **Standardized Approach (Chapter 4):** This approach uses external credit ratings to assign risk weights to different asset classes.  For example, exposures to sovereigns, banks, and corporates are assigned risk weights based on their credit ratings.  Specific rules also exist for off-balance sheet exposures, defaulted exposures, and other asset types.

* **Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) Approach (Chapter 5):** This approach allows banks to use their internal estimates of risk parameters (Probability of Default - PD, Loss Given Default - LGD, Exposure at Default - EAD, and Effective Maturity - M) to calculate RWA.  The IRB approach has more complex formulas and requires regulatory approval.  Specific rules apply to different asset classes, including corporate exposures, residential mortgages, and retail exposures.  There are also rules for purchased receivables, considering both default risk and dilution risk.

**General Calculation:**

The total RWA for credit risk is the sum of RWAs calculated for each exposure using the chosen approach.  For example, under the standardized approach, each exposure's RWA is calculated by multiplying the exposure amount by the assigned risk weight.  Under the IRB approach, the calculation involves more complex formulas using the bank's internal risk estimates.

**Specific Cases:**

The retrieved information also highlights specific cases, such as:

* **Purchased Receivables (Chapter 5, Section 5.6):**  For purchased receivables, there are IRB capital charges for both default risk and dilution risk.  The risk weight for default risk depends on the asset class and the availability of internal or external data for estimating PDs and LGDs.

* **Defaulted Exposures (Chapter 4, Section 4.1.21):**  Specific criteria define defaulted exposures, such as exposures past due for more than 90 days or exposures to defaulted borrowers.

* **Other Assets (Chapter 4, Section 4.1.23):**  Various other assets, such as premises, plant and equipment, and other investments, are assigned specific risk weights.


**Additional Considerations:**

* **Capital Floor (Chapter 1, Section 1.5):** The total RWA is subject to a capital floor based on the standardized approach.

* **Regulatory Adjustments (Chapter 2, Section 2.3):** Certain items are deducted from capital as regulatory adjustments.

For detailed implementation guidance and specific formulas, please refer to the relevant chapters of the OSFI CAR guidelines mentioned above.  It is recommended to seek professional advice for specific implementation questions.
