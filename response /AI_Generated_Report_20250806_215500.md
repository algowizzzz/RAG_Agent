## Risk-Based Capital Requirements for Market Risk

This report details risk-based capital requirements for market risk, focusing on the Canadian context as outlined by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI).

### Market Risk Capital Requirements

* **Applicability:** Market risk requirements apply to internationally active institutions and all Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs) designated by OSFI. OSFI can also apply these requirements to other institutions on a case-by-case basis if trading activities constitute a significant portion of their operations (Chapter 1, Page 7, Paragraph 15).

* **Trading Book vs. Banking Book:** Institutions must categorize instruments into either the trading book or the banking book. Market risk capital requirements apply to instruments held in the trading book.  Instruments not in the trading book, along with all other assets (banking book exposures), are subject to credit risk capital requirements (Chapter 1, Page 7, Paragraph 16).

* **Calculating Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA) for Market Risk:** RWA for market risk encompasses instruments in the trading book and foreign exchange and commodities risk for banking book exposures.  These are calculated using either:
    * The standardized approach (Chapter 1, Page 7, Paragraph 17i).  Details of this approach are found in Chapter 9, Section 9.5 of the CAR guideline, although this specific section was not included in the retrieved content.
    * The internal models approach (Chapter 1, Page 7, Paragraph 17ii). Details of this approach are found in Chapter 9, Section 9.6 of the CAR guideline, although this specific section was not included in the retrieved content.

* **Internal Models Approach (IMA) Approval:** Institutions must obtain explicit prior approval from OSFI to use the IMA for regulatory capital calculations (Chapter 1, Page 8, Paragraph 21).  OSFI's approval process may involve conditions, including potentially higher initial capital floors, and ongoing monitoring of compliance (Chapter 1, Pages 8-9, Paragraphs 22-26).

* **Capital Floor for Internal Model-Based Approaches:**  Institutions using internal models for credit risk, counterparty credit risk, or market risk are subject to a capital floor. This floor ensures that capital requirements don't fall below a specified percentage of the requirements calculated using standardized approaches (Chapter 1, Page 9, Paragraph 27).  The capital floor calculation involves comparing the floor amount (Section 1.5.1) with an adjusted capital requirement (Section 1.5.2) and adding the difference to total RWA if the floor is higher (Chapter 1, Page 9, Paragraph 28).  The standardized approach is used for calculating the capital floor for market risk (Chapter 1, Page 10, Paragraph 33).  Before November 2023/January 2024, the calculation uses the VaR and standardized approaches from the 2019 CAR guidelines (excluding CRM, IRC, and SVaR charges). After this date, the standardized approach from the current guideline applies.

### Additional Considerations for D-SIBs

D-SIBs, due to their systemic importance, face additional capital requirements beyond the general market risk requirements:

* **D-SIB Surcharge:** D-SIBs are subject to a 1% CET1 surcharge on RWA (Chapter 1, Page 18, Paragraph 65). This surcharge is implemented as an extension of the capital conservation buffer.

* **Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB):**  D-SIBs must also maintain a DSB, ranging from 0% to 4% of total RWA, to address systemic vulnerabilities not fully captured by Pillar 1 requirements (Chapter 1, Page 19, Paragraph 67).  The DSB level is set by OSFI, in consultation with FISC, and is the same for all D-SIBs (Chapter 1, Pages 19-20, Paragraphs 68-73).  Breaching the DSB doesn't trigger automatic distribution constraints but requires a remediation plan submitted to OSFI.

* **Capital Targets:** D-SIBs have higher target capital ratios than SMSBs, including the DSB in their CET1, Tier 1, and Total capital targets (Chapter 1, Page 21, Table 8).

This report provides an overview of market risk capital requirements based on the provided content.  Further details on specific calculation methodologies (standardized and internal models approaches) would require referencing Chapters 9, and other relevant chapters of the CAR guideline.  Additionally, information on specific vulnerabilities covered by the DSB can be found on OSFI's website.
