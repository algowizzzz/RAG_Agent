The CAR Guideline is not made pursuant to subsections 485(2) or 949(2) of the BA, or \nto subsection 473(2) of the TLCA. However, the capital standards set out in this guideline \ntogether with the leverage requirements set out in the Leverage Requirements Guideline provide \nthe framework within which the Superintendent assesses whether a bank, a bank holding \ncompany, a trust company, or a loan company maintains adequate capital pursuant to the Acts. \nFor this purpose, the Superintendent has established two minimum standards: the leverage ratio \ndescribed in the Leverage Requirements Guideline, and the risk-based capital ratio described in \nthis guideline.\n1 The first test provides an overall measure of the adequacy of an institution's \ncapital. The second measure focuses on risk faced by the institution. Notwithstanding that a \nbank, bank holding company, trust company, or loan company may meet these standards, the \nSuperintendent may direct a bank or bank holding company to increase its capital under \nsubsections 485(3) or 949(3) of the BA, or a trust company or a loan company to increase its \ncapital under subsection 473(3) of the TLCA. \n \nOSFI, as a member of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, participated in the \ndevelopment of the Basel capital framework on which this guideline is based. Where relevant, \nthe Basel framework paragraph numbers are provided in square brackets at the end of each \nparagraph referencing material from the Basel framework.  \n \n1    The capital and leverage requirements for domestic systemically important banks are supplemented by the \nrequirements described in OSFI’s Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) Guideline .",

Under the IRB approaches, exposure at default (EAD) is determined gross of all specific \nallowances. The amount used in the calculation of EAD should normally be based on book \nvalue, except for the following where EAD should be based on amortized cost: \n• loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge; and \n• debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensive Income. \n \n11. Under the standardized approach, on-balance sheet exposures should normally be \nmeasured at book value, except the following where exposures should be measured at amortized \ncost: \n• loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge;  \n• debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensive Income; and \n• own-use property, plant and equipment \n \n12. For own-use property that is accounted for using the revaluation model, reported \nexposures should be based on an adjusted book value that reverses the impact of: \n• the balance of any revaluation surplus included in Other Comprehensive Income; and \n• accumulated net after-tax revaluation losses that are reflected in retained earnings or as a \nresult of subsequent revaluations \n \n13. The approaches listed in paragraph 8 specify how institutions should measure the size of \ntheir exposures (i.e. EAD) and determine their RWA. Certain types of transactions in the \nbanking book and trading book (such as derivatives and securities financial transactions) give \nrise to counterparty credit risk, for which the measurement of the size of the exposure can be \ncomplex. Therefore, the approaches listed in paragraph 8 include, or cross refer to, the following \nmethods available to determine the size of the counterparty exposures (refer to section 7.1 of \nChapter 7 for an overview of the counterparty credit risk requirements including the types of \ntransactions to which the methods below can be applied): \n \n6 This includes assets and liabilities booked outside of Canada as well as assets and liabilities of non -residents \nbooked in Canada.",

The steps involved in the application for approval of \nthese approaches are outlined in OSFI Implementation Notes.  \n \n22.

Capital Floor–Internal Model Based Approaches \n \n27. To reduce excessive variability of RWA and to enhance the comparability of risk-based \ncapital ratios, institutions using internal model-based approaches for credit risk, counterparty \ncredit risk, or market risk are subject to a floor requirement that is applied to RWA. The capital \nfloor ensures that institutions’ capital requirements do not fall below a certain percentage of \ncapital requirements derived under standardized approaches. The calculation of the floor is set \nout below for institutions that have implemented the IRB approach for credit risk, IMM for \ncounterparty credit risk, or IMA for market risk. Institutions that have only implemented the \nstandardized approaches for credit risk, counterparty credit risk, and market risk are not subject \nto the capital floor. \n \nInstitutions that have implemented one of the internal model-based approaches for credit risk, \ncounterparty credit risk, or market risk must calculate the difference between: \ni. the capital floor as defined in section 1.5.1, and \nii. an adjusted capital requirement as defined in section 1.5.2. \n[Basel Framework, RBC 20.11] \n \n28. If the capital floor amount is larger than the adjusted capital requirement (i.e. the \ndifference is positive), institutions are required to add the difference to the total RWAs otherwise \ncalculated under this guideline. This adjusted RWA figure must be used as the denominator in \nthe calculation of the risk-based capital ratios. \n \n1.5.1. The Capital Floor \n \n29. The base of the capital floor includes the standardized approaches to credit risk and \noperational risk as described in paragraphs 31 through 35. The specific approach for market risk \nis described in paragraph 33. The capital floor is derived by applying an adjustment factor to the \nnet total of the following amounts: \ni. total risk-weighted assets for the capital floor, less \nii. 12.5 times the amount of any general allowance that may be recognized in Tier 2 capital \nfollowing the standardized approach methodology as outlined in Chapter 2 of this \nguideline.",

Total risk-weighted assets are determined by multiplying the capital requirements for \nmarket risk and operational risk by 12.5 and adding the resulting figures to risk-weighted assets \nfor credit risk. The capital ratios are calculated by dividing regulatory capital by total risk-\nweighted assets. The three ratios measure CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital adequacy and are \ncalculated as follows: \nRisk Based Capital Ratios =  𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶\n𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅  \n \nWhere: \nCapital = CET1, Tier 1, or Total capital as set out in Chapter 2. \nRWA = Risk-weighted assets, calculated as described in paragraph 7. \n \n39.

When buffers have been drawn down, there is a range of actions that can be taken to \nrebuild buffers including reducing discretionary distributions of earnings. This could include \nreducing dividends or other discretionary payments on shares or other capital instruments, share \nbuy-backs and, to the extent they are discretionary, staff bonus payments.\n12 Institutions may also \nchoose to raise new capital from the private sector as an alternative to conserving internally \ngenerated capital. Should buffers be drawn down, institutions should implement a capital \nrestoration plan for rebuilding buffers within a reasonable timeframe or, where the breach is \nexpected to be corrected promptly, a plan that provides assurance that the capital conservation \nbuffer will be restored on a sustained basis. The capital restoration plan should be discussed with \nOSFI as part of the capital planning process. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.21] \n \n45. Greater efforts should be made to rebuild buffers the more they have been depleted.

It is not acceptable for institutions which have depleted their capital buffers to use future \npredictions of recovery as justification for maintaining generous distributions to shareholders, \nother capital providers and employees. These stakeholders, rather than depositors, must bear the \nrisk that recovery will not be forthcoming. It is also not acceptable for institutions that have \ndepleted their capital buffers to use the distribution of capital as a way to signal their financial \nstrength.

The distribution constraints \nincrease as institutions’ capital levels approach the minimum requirements. By design, the \nconstraints imposed on institutions with capital levels at the top of the range would be minimal. \nThis reflects an expectation that institutions’ capital levels may fall into this range from time to \ntime. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.2 and 30.3] \n \n49. Table 5 sets out the minimum capital conservation ratios an institution must meet at \nvarious levels of CET1 capital.\n14 The applicable conservation ratio must be recalculated at each \ndistribution date. Once imposed, conservation ratios will remain in place until such time as capital \nratios have been restored. If an institution wants to make payments in excess of the constraints set \nout in Table 5, sufficient capital must be raised in the private sector to fully compensate for the \nexcess distribution. This alternative should be discussed with OSFI as part of an institution’s \nInternal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). For the purposes of determining the \nminimum capital conservation ratio, the CET1 ratio includes amounts used to meet the 4.5% \nminimum CET1 requirement, but excludes any additional CET1 needed to meet the 6% Tier 1 and \n8% Total Capital requirements, as well as any CET1 capital needed to meet D-SIBs’ Total Loss \nAbsorbing Capacity (TLAC) requirements where applicable. For example, an institution with 8% \nCET1 and no Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital would meet all minimum capital requirements, but \nwould have a 0% capital conservation buffer and therefore be subject to the 100% constraint on \ncapital distributions. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4] \n \nTable 5: Minimum capital conservation ratios for corresponding levels of CET1 \nCET1 Ratio Minimum Capital Conservation Ratios (expressed as percentage \nof earnings) \n4.5% - 5.125% 100% \n>5.125% - 5.75% 80% \n>5.75% - 6.375% 60% \n>6.375% - 7.0% 40% \n>7.0% 0% \n \n50. If an institution’s capital ratio falls below the levels set out in Table 4, capital \nconservation ratios will be imposed that automatically limit distributions. As outlined in Table 5, \nthese limits increase as an institution’s capital levels approach the minimum requirements. For \nexample, an institution with a CET1 capital ratio in the range of 5.125% to 5.75% would be \nrequired to maintain the equivalent of 80% of its earnings in the subsequent payment period (i.e. \npay out no more than 20% in capital distributions). For clarity, where an institution’s disclosed \nratio is within the ranges where restrictions apply, distributions for the following payment period \nwill be constrained based on the most recently reported ratio irrespective of the current capital \nposition of the institution. Restrictions will remain in place until the capital conservation buffer \nis restored. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4] \n \n \n14  Similar capital conservation ratios apply where an institution breaches its Tier 1 capital or Total capital \nrequirements. In the event that an institution simultaneously breaches more than one capital requirement (e.g. 7% \nCET1, 8.5% Tier 1, 10.5% Total capital) it must apply the most constraining capital conservation ratio.",

Based on this assessment, a countercyclical buffer requirement, \nranging from 0% to 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets,\n18 will be put in place when \n \n15  SAC is a non-statutory body chaired by the Deputy Minister of Finance. Its membership is the same as the \nFinancial Institutions Supervisory Committee (“FISC”), i.e. OSFI, the Department of Finance, the Bank of \nCanada, the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada. The SAC \noperates as a consultative body and provides a forum for policy discussion on issues pertaining to the financial \nsector.  \n16  The document entitled Guidance for national authorities operating the countercyclical capital buffer , sets out the \nprinciples that national authorities have agreed to follow in making buffer decisions. This document provides \ninformation that should help institutions to understand and anticipate the buffer decisions made by national \nauthorities in the jurisdictions to which they have credit exposures.

OSFI \nregulated deposit-taking institutions who are subsidiaries of an OSFI regulated deposit-taking institution are not \nsubject to the countercyclical buffer. \n27   The pre-announced buffer decision and actual buffer in place will be published on the BIS website.  \n28   For Category III SMSBs, the countercyclical buffer would be applied as a % of [Adjusted Total Assets + RWA \nOperational Risk]. \n29  Annex 1 contains additional details around OSFI’s process for designating Canadian institutions as D -SIBs. \n30   BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.1 to 40.6 \n31  Similar capital conservation ratios apply where a D-SIB breaches its Tier 1 capital or Total capital requirements. \nIn the event that a D-SIB simultaneously breaches more than one capital requirement (e.g. 8% CET1, 9.5% Tier \n1, 11.5% Total Capital) it must apply the most constraining capital conservation ratio.",

In addition to the DSB, D-SIBs may be required \nto hold further Pillar II capital, as warranted, to address idiosyncratic or systemic risks that are \nnot adequately captured by the Pillar I requirements and buffers. Decisions on the calibration of \nthe DSB are based on supervisory judgement, informed by analytical work on a range of \nvulnerabilities, and are made in consultation with the Financial Institutions Supervisory \nCommittee (FISC).\n33 \n \n68. The level of the DSB will range between 0 and 4.0% of a D-SIB’s total RWA calculated \nunder this guideline.

Unlike the other buffers described in this guideline, the DSB is not a Pillar 1 buffer and \nbreaches will not result in D-SIBs being subject to the automatic constraints on capital \ndistributions described in section 1.7. If a D-SIB breaches the buffer (i.e. dips into the buffer \nwhen it has not been released), OSFI will require a remediation plan.

In the latter case, \na decrease would be intended to allow D-SIBs to continue to provide loans and services to credit \nworthy households and businesses and/or to incur losses without breaching their capital targets. \nIncreases to the buffer may occur when OSFI is of the view that it would be prudent for D-SIBs \nto hold additional capital to protect against the identified vulnerabilities. Increases will be subject \nto a phase-in period; decreases will be effective immediately. \n \n1. 10. Capital Targets \n \n74. In addition to the minimum capital requirements described in section 1.6, OSFI expects \nall institutions to maintain target capital ratios equal to or greater than the minimum capital ratios \nplus the conservation buffer.\n35 For SMSBs, this means target ratios of at least 7% for CET1, \n8.5% for Tier 1 and 10.5% for Total capital. D-SIBs are expected to maintain target capital ratios \nequal to or greater than the minimum capital ratios plus the sum of the conservation buffer, the \nD-SIB surcharge and the DSB. For D-SIBs, this equates to target ratios of least 8% for CET1, \n9.5% for Tier 1, and 11.5% for Total capital plus the DSB.36 The target capital ratios for SMSBs \nand D-SIBs are summarized below in Table 8 below and illustrated in Annex 2.  \n \n \n \n \n \n35   The conservation buffer is the sum of the 2.5% capital conservation buffer plus any countercyclical buffer add-\nons, where applicable. \n36   As an example, where the DSB is set to 2% of RWA, D-SIBs’ target capital ratios would be at least 10% for \nCET1, 11.5% for Tier 1 and 13.5% for Total capital. This reflects a conservation buffer of 2.5% and a D -SIB \nsurcharge of 1.0%.",

The framework39 for dealing with D-SIBs set out by the BCBS indicates that domestic \nsystemic importance should be assessed with reference to the impact that an institution’s failure \ncould have on the domestic economy. Further, it notes that this assessment should consider \ninstitution-specific characteristics of systemic importance, such as size, inter-connectedness and \nsubstitutability, which are correlated with the systemic impact of failure. Accordingly, OSFI’s \nassessment of domestic systemic importance for Canadian institutions considers a range of \nindicators such as asset size, intra-financial claims and liabilities, and an institution’s roles in \ndomestic financial markets and in financial infrastructures. This section describes OSFI’s \ninferences from various measures of systemic importance.  \n \nSize  \n \n2. In general, an institution’s distress or failure is more likely to damage the Canadian \nfinancial system or economy if its activities comprise a large share of domestic banking activity. \nWhen Canadian institutions are compared according to their size as measured by total \nconsolidated assets, and by place of booking of assets, that is, according to whether the assets are \nbooked in Canada or abroad, the data show that: \n• the largest six banks account for more than 90% total banking assets; \n• the differences among the largest banks are smaller if only domestic assets are \nconsidered; and \n• relative systemic importance declines rapidly after the top five banks and after the \nsixth bank.  \n \nInter-connections \n \n3. The more inter-connected an institution is to other financial institutions, the greater is the \npotential for the failure of that institution to transmit problems throughout the financial system \nand to the broader economy. As a result, measurements of inter-connectedness also inform \ninstitutions’ systemic importance. Comparing Canadian institutions according to measures of \nintra-financial assets (i.e. claims on other financial institutions) and intra-financial liabilities (i.e. \nobligations to other financial institutions) again points to the dominance of the largest Canadian \nbanks. The rank-ordering among these banks, however, depends on the specific inter-\nconnectedness measure under consideration.   \n \nSubstitutability \n \n4. The systemic impact of an institution’s distress or failure is greater the less easily it can \nbe replaced as both a market participant and a financial service provider. As a result, OSFI’s \nidentification of D-SIBs also takes into account the types of roles that institutions play in \ndomestic financial markets and in domestic financial infrastructures, which inform views \nregarding substitutability. For example, this includes underwriter rankings in Canadian financial \n \n39  A framework for dealing with domestic systemically important banks (BCBS: October 2012)",

The largest \nbanks are also the dominant participants in CDSX, the clearing and settlement system for \nsecurities transactions in Canada. Some large Canadian banks also play key roles as members of \nthe CLS Bank, the global institution that settles foreign exchange transactions between banks in \nCanadian dollars and other major currencies.41 For example, the Royal Bank of Canada and the \nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce are the key Canadian-dollar liquidity providers for \nsettling Canadian dollar foreign exchange transactions through the CLS network. \n \n5. A variety of additional information has been assessed and recurring themes across the \nrange of evidence are the following:  \n• The five largest banks are by far the dominant banks in Canada, and consistently play \ncentral roles in a range of activities in the Canadian financial system; and   \n• The rank-order importance of the largest banks, as well as the relative differences \nbetween them, varies somewhat according to the measure considered.   \n \n6. This suggests that there are strong grounds for treating these banks in the same way, \nrather than relying on arbitrary weights to develop a single index of systemic importance. \nFurther, distinguishing reliably between the adverse effects on the Canadian economy from \nindividual D-SIB failures is largely moot, given the difficulty of credibly differentiating between \nthe large adverse impacts on the Canadian economy from the failure of any one of the largest \nbanks. This also argues against making distinctions between identified Canadian D-SIBs to \nassign degrees of systemic importance.\n  \n \n7. Given these various considerations, the Canadian D-SIBs are judged to be Bank of \nMontreal, The Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank of \nCanada, and The Toronto-Dominion Bank, without further distinction between them. National \nBank of Canada has also been designated as a D-SIB given its importance relative to other less \nprominent banks and in the interest of prudence given the inherent challenges in identifying \nahead of time which banks are likely to be systemic in times of stress. The designation of D-SIB \nstatus will be periodically reviewed and updated as needed.  \n \nHigher Loss Absorbency Targets \n \n8. The goal of a higher loss absorbency target is to reduce further the probability of failure \nof a D-SIB relative to non-systemic institutions, reflecting the greater impact that a D-SIB failure \nmay have on the domestic financial system and the economy. This surcharge takes into account \nthe structure of the Canadian financial system, the importance of large banks to the financial \narchitecture, and the expanded regulatory toolkit required to resolve a troubled financial \n \n40   ACSS handles all Canadian dollar payments not processed by the LVTS. \n41  CLS Bank provides a real-time global network that links a number of national payments systems to settle the \nforeign exchange transactions of its member banks",

The BCBS D-SIB framework provides for national discretion to accommodate \ncharacteristics of the domestic financial system and other local features, including the domestic \npolicy framework. The additional capital surcharge for banks designated as systemically \nimportant provides credible additional loss absorbency given: \n• extreme loss events as a percentage of RWA among this peer group over the past 25 \nyears would be less than the combination of the CET1 (2.5%) capital conservation \nbuffer and an additional 1%; and \n• current business models of the six largest banks are generally less exposed to the fat \ntailed risks associated with investment banking than some international peers, and the \nsix largest banks have a greater reliance on retail funding models compared to \nwholesale funding than some international peers – features that proved beneficial in \nlight of the experience of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. \nFrom a forward-looking perspective: \n• Canadian D-SIBs that hold capital at current targets plus a 1% surcharge (i.e. 8%) \nshould be able to weather a wide range of severe but plausible shocks without \nbecoming non-viable; and  \n• the higher loss absorbency in a crisis scenario achieved by the conversion to common \nequity) of the 2% to 3% in Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 NVCC capital instruments \npromoted by Basel III also adds to the resiliency of banks.  \n \nRelationship with Basel Committee G-SIB Framework \n \n9. OSFI has adopted the Basel Committee’s framework on the assessment methodology for \nG-SIBs. The assessment methodology for G-SIBs follows an indicator-based approach agreed by \nthe BCBS that will determine which institutions are to be designated as G-SIBs and subject to \nadditional loss absorbency requirements that range from 1% to 3.5% RWA, depending on an \ninstitution's global systemic importance.\n42 For Canadian D-SIBs that are also designated as G-\nSIBs, the higher of the D-SIB and G-SIB surcharges will apply.43  \n \nSupervisory Implications \n \n10. Canadian D-SIBs are expected to have advanced practices in terms of the design and \noperation of oversight functions and internal controls. OSFI expects these practices to continue \nto improve as supervision becomes more intensive and international best practices evolve. The \ninstitutions designated as D-SIBs have historically had, and will continue to be subject to, more \nintensive supervision because of their larger size, broader and more complex business models \nand consequently more significant risk profiles. The principles of risk based supervisory \nintensity are reflected in OSFI’s Supervisory Framework.\n44 The Framework is applied on a \nconsolidated basis to all Canadian institutions and requires OSFI supervisors to determine the \n \n42   BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.1 to 40.6 and SCO 40.1 to 50.20  \n43   Details related to G-SIB’s annual public disclosure requirements are included in OSFI’s Global Systemically \nImportant Banks – Public Disclosure Requirements Advisory    \n44  OSFI’s Supervisory Framework (OSFI: February 2011)",

However, the capital standards set out in this guideline \ntogether with the leverage requirements set out in the Leverage Requirements Guideline provide \nthe framework within which the Superintendent assesses whether a bank, a bank holding \ncompany, a trust company, or a loan company maintains adequate capital pursuant to the Acts. \nFor this purpose, the Superintendent has established two minimum standards: the leverage ratio \ndescribed in the Leverage Requirements Guideline, and the risk-based capital ratio described in \nthis guideline.\n1 The first test provides an overall measure of the adequacy of an institution's \ncapital. The second measure focuses on risk faced by the institution. Notwithstanding that a \nbank, bank holding company, trust company, or loan company may meet these standards, the \nSuperintendent may direct a bank or bank holding company to increase its capital under \nsubsections 485(3) or 949(3) of the BA, or a trust company or a loan company to increase its \ncapital under subsection 473(3) of the TLCA. \n \nOSFI, as a member of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, participated in the \ndevelopment of the Basel capital framework on which this guideline is based. Where relevant, \nthe Basel framework paragraph numbers are provided in square brackets at the end of each \nparagraph referencing material from the Basel framework.  \n \n1    The capital and leverage requirements for domestic systemically important banks are supplemented by the \nrequirements described in OSFI’s Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) Guideline .",

Institutions that have total regulatory capital (net of deductions) in excess of CAD $5 \nbillion, or that have greater than 10% of total assets or greater than 10% of total liabilities that \nare international,\n6 are expected to use IRB approaches for all material portfolios and credit \nbusinesses in Canada and the United States.   \n10. Under the IRB approaches, exposure at default (EAD) is determined gross of all specific \nallowances. The amount used in the calculation of EAD should normally be based on book \nvalue, except for the following where EAD should be based on amortized cost: \n• loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge; and \n• debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensive Income. \n \n11. Under the standardized approach, on-balance sheet exposures should normally be \nmeasured at book value, except the following where exposures should be measured at amortized \ncost: \n• loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge;  \n• debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensive Income; and \n• own-use property, plant and equipment \n \n12. For own-use property that is accounted for using the revaluation model, reported \nexposures should be based on an adjusted book value that reverses the impact of: \n• the balance of any revaluation surplus included in Other Comprehensive Income; and \n• accumulated net after-tax revaluation losses that are reflected in retained earnings or as a \nresult of subsequent revaluations \n \n13. The approaches listed in paragraph 8 specify how institutions should measure the size of \ntheir exposures (i.e. EAD) and determine their RWA. Certain types of transactions in the \nbanking book and trading book (such as derivatives and securities financial transactions) give \nrise to counterparty credit risk, for which the measurement of the size of the exposure can be \ncomplex. Therefore, the approaches listed in paragraph 8 include, or cross refer to, the following \nmethods available to determine the size of the counterparty exposures (refer to section 7.1 of \nChapter 7 for an overview of the counterparty credit risk requirements including the types of \ntransactions to which the methods below can be applied): \n \n6 This includes assets and liabilities booked outside of Canada as well as assets and liabilities of non -residents \nbooked in Canada.",

Institutions must receive explicit prior approval from OSFI in order to use any of the \nfollowing model-based approaches for regulatory capital purposes: the Foundation and \nAdvanced IRB Approaches to credit risk, the IMM to counterparty credit risk, and the Internal \nModels Approach (IMA) to market risk. The steps involved in the application for approval of \nthese approaches are outlined in OSFI Implementation Notes.  \n \n22. OSFI will consider approval with conditions for those institutions that have made a \nsubstantial effort and are found to satisfy most requirements of the internal model regime. The \ninstitution must also be able to provide out of sample back-testing and parallel reporting \nconsistent with OSFI's capital models implementation note.\n8 Institutions that do not receive \napproval will be required to employ a form of the Standardized Approach. \n \n23. An institution achieving approval with conditions for one of the model-based \napproaches will normally be allowed to use the approach (in some cases only after OSFI \nconfirms closure of certain deficiencies) but may be required to adhere to a higher initial capital \nfloor. Once it achieves full compliance with all rollout and data requirements, and OSFI has \nagreed, the institution may proceed to the capital floor of 72.5% described in section 1.5. In \neither case, OSFI will not rule out the possibility of requiring floors on individual asset classes or \nreviewing approval conditions based on implementation progress.  \n \n24. Once approved, institutions are expected to meet the qualitative and quantitative \nrequirements for the internal model approach as set out in the guideline and the supporting \nimplementation notes on an ongoing basis. \n \n1.4.1. Approval to use the IRB Approaches to Credit Risk \n \n25. For IRB credit risk approval, besides meeting the qualitative and quantitative \nrequirements for an IRB rating system, institutions will need, at a minimum, to satisfy the \nfollowing requirements to obtain approval with conditions (with a possibly higher initial floor): \n• The institution is meeting the IRB use test principles.\n9 The use test prohibits institutions \nfrom using default and loss estimates from their own internal ratings that are developed \nfor the sole purpose of calculating regulatory capital, these systems must be used in other \noperations of the institution. \n• On implementation, the institution will have rolled out the Advanced IRB (AIRB) or \nFoundation IRB (FIRB) approach to approximately 80% of its consolidated credit \nexposures, as of the end of the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year in which the institution \nreceives approval to use the IRB approach, measured in terms of gross exposure and total \ncredit RWA.  \n \n \n8      Implementation Note - Assessment of Regulatory Capital Models for Deposit-Taking Institutions \n9     The Use of Ratings and Estimates of Default and Loss at IRB Institutions – Implementation Note",

Once an institution has received an approval to use the IRB Approach, OSFI will \nmonitor, on a quarterly basis, the institution’s compliance with the 80% IRB threshold for its \nconsolidated credit exposures for which an IRB approach is permitted. In the post-approval \nperiod, compliance will be measured in terms of gross exposure and total credit risk-weighted \nassets as at the applicable quarter.  \n \n \n1. 5. Capital Floor–Internal Model Based Approaches \n \n27. To reduce excessive variability of RWA and to enhance the comparability of risk-based \ncapital ratios, institutions using internal model-based approaches for credit risk, counterparty \ncredit risk, or market risk are subject to a floor requirement that is applied to RWA. The capital \nfloor ensures that institutions’ capital requirements do not fall below a certain percentage of \ncapital requirements derived under standardized approaches. The calculation of the floor is set \nout below for institutions that have implemented the IRB approach for credit risk, IMM for \ncounterparty credit risk, or IMA for market risk. Institutions that have only implemented the \nstandardized approaches for credit risk, counterparty credit risk, and market risk are not subject \nto the capital floor. \n \nInstitutions that have implemented one of the internal model-based approaches for credit risk, \ncounterparty credit risk, or market risk must calculate the difference between: \ni. the capital floor as defined in section 1.5.1, and \nii. an adjusted capital requirement as defined in section 1.5.2. \n[Basel Framework, RBC 20.11] \n \n28. If the capital floor amount is larger than the adjusted capital requirement (i.e. the \ndifference is positive), institutions are required to add the difference to the total RWAs otherwise \ncalculated under this guideline. This adjusted RWA figure must be used as the denominator in \nthe calculation of the risk-based capital ratios. \n \n1.5.1. The Capital Floor \n \n29. The base of the capital floor includes the standardized approaches to credit risk and \noperational risk as described in paragraphs 31 through 35. The specific approach for market risk \nis described in paragraph 33. The capital floor is derived by applying an adjustment factor to the \nnet total of the following amounts: \ni. total risk-weighted assets for the capital floor, less \nii. 12.5 times the amount of any general allowance that may be recognized in Tier 2 capital \nfollowing the standardized approach methodology as outlined in Chapter 2 of this \nguideline.",

Credit risk RWAs are calculated using the standardized approach as outlined in Chapter \n4 of this guideline for all asset classes except securitization. The treatment of securitization \nexposures under the capital floor is outlined in section 6.11 of Chapter 6. Credit risk RWAs also \ninclude charges for central counterparty (CCP) exposures and non-Delivery-versus-Payment \n(DvP) trades outlined in Chapter 7, and credit valuation adjustment (CVA) outlined in Chapter 8 \nof this guideline. \n \n32. For the exposure values used in the calculation of credit risk RWAs, the treatment of \ncredit risk mitigation should follow the standardized approach outlined in section 4.3 of Chapter \n4 of this guideline, while counterparty credit risk exposures must be determined using the \nstandardized approach to counterparty credit risk outlined in section 7.1.7 of Chapter 7 of this \nguideline. Additionally, in order to reduce the operational complexity of implementing the \ncapital floor, institutions may choose to apply the IRB definition of default for IRB portfolios \nrather than applying the standardized approach default definition.  \n \n33. Prior to November 2023/January 2024,\n10 market risk RWAs are calculated using the \nvalue at risk (VaR) and standardized approaches as outlined in Chapter 9 of the 2019 CAR \nguideline, excluding the comprehensive risk measure (CRM, section 9.11.5.2), the incremental \nrisk charge (IRC, Appendix 9-9), and stressed VaR (SVaR, paragraph 194i) capital charges. \nAfter November 2023/January2024, market risk RWAs are calculated using the standardized \napproach as outlined in Chapter 9 of this guideline.  \n \n34. Operational risk RWAs are calculated using either the Standardized Approach or the \nSimplified Standardized Approach, outlined in Chapter 3 of this guideline. \n \n35. The following approaches are not permitted to be used, directly or indirectly, in the \ncalculation of the capital floor:  \na. IRB approach to credit risk;  \nb.

The adjusted capital requirement is based on application of all of the chapters of this \nguideline and is equal to the net total of the following amounts: \ni. total risk-weighted assets, plus \nii. 12.5 times the provisioning shortfall deduction, less \niii. 12.5 times excess provisions included in Tier 2, less \niv. 12.5 times the amount of general allowances that may be recognized in Tier 2 in respect \nof exposures for which the standardized approach is used. \n \n37. The provisioning shortfall deduction, excess provisions included in Tier 2, and general \nallowances in Tier 2 in respect of standardized portfolios are defined in section 2.1.3.7 of \nChapter 2 of this guideline. \n \n1. 6. Calculation of OSFI Minimum Capital Requirements \n \n1.6.1. Risk-Based Capital Ratios for D-SIBs and Category I and II SMSBs  \n \n38. Institutions are expected to meet minimum risk-based capital requirements for \nexposures to credit risk, operational risk and, where they have significant trading activity, market \nrisk. Total risk-weighted assets are determined by multiplying the capital requirements for \nmarket risk and operational risk by 12.5 and adding the resulting figures to risk-weighted assets \nfor credit risk. The capital ratios are calculated by dividing regulatory capital by total risk-\nweighted assets. The three ratios measure CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital adequacy and are \ncalculated as follows: \nRisk Based Capital Ratios =  𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶\n𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅  \n \nWhere: \nCapital = CET1, Tier 1, or Total capital as set out in Chapter 2. \nRWA = Risk-weighted assets, calculated as described in paragraph 7. \n \n39. Table 2 provides the minimum CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital ratios for institutions \nbefore application of the capital conservation buffer.  \n \n \n11  There are two exceptions to this rule. One is that banks who have approval to use the IMM and who are \ncurrently using the Standardized CVA (S-CVA) approach are permitted to use the IMM EADs and maturities in \nthe calculation of the S-CVA for purposes of the capital floor. The other is that banks currently using the \nAdvanced CVA (A-CVA) approach for purposes of the capital floor may continue to do so. Both of these \nexceptions expire when the revised CVA framework is implemented in the first fiscal quarter of 2024.",

When buffers have been drawn down, there is a range of actions that can be taken to \nrebuild buffers including reducing discretionary distributions of earnings. This could include \nreducing dividends or other discretionary payments on shares or other capital instruments, share \nbuy-backs and, to the extent they are discretionary, staff bonus payments.\n12 Institutions may also \nchoose to raise new capital from the private sector as an alternative to conserving internally \ngenerated capital. Should buffers be drawn down, institutions should implement a capital \nrestoration plan for rebuilding buffers within a reasonable timeframe or, where the breach is \nexpected to be corrected promptly, a plan that provides assurance that the capital conservation \nbuffer will be restored on a sustained basis. The capital restoration plan should be discussed with \nOSFI as part of the capital planning process. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.21] \n \n45. Greater efforts should be made to rebuild buffers the more they have been depleted. In \nthe absence of raising capital in the private sector, the share of earnings retained by institutions \nfor the purpose of rebuilding capital buffers should increase the nearer their actual capital levels \nare to the minimum capital requirements. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.22] \n \n46. It is not acceptable for institutions which have depleted their capital buffers to use future \npredictions of recovery as justification for maintaining generous distributions to shareholders, \nother capital providers and employees. These stakeholders, rather than depositors, must bear the \nrisk that recovery will not be forthcoming. It is also not acceptable for institutions that have \ndepleted their capital buffers to use the distribution of capital as a way to signal their financial \nstrength. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.23] \n \n1.7.1. Capital Conservation Buffer \n \n47. The capital conservation buffer establishes a safeguard above the minimum capital \nrequirements and can only be met with CET1 capital.

The distribution constraints \nincrease as institutions’ capital levels approach the minimum requirements. By design, the \nconstraints imposed on institutions with capital levels at the top of the range would be minimal. \nThis reflects an expectation that institutions’ capital levels may fall into this range from time to \ntime. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.2 and 30.3] \n \n49. Table 5 sets out the minimum capital conservation ratios an institution must meet at \nvarious levels of CET1 capital.\n14 The applicable conservation ratio must be recalculated at each \ndistribution date. Once imposed, conservation ratios will remain in place until such time as capital \nratios have been restored. If an institution wants to make payments in excess of the constraints set \nout in Table 5, sufficient capital must be raised in the private sector to fully compensate for the \nexcess distribution. This alternative should be discussed with OSFI as part of an institution’s \nInternal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). For the purposes of determining the \nminimum capital conservation ratio, the CET1 ratio includes amounts used to meet the 4.5% \nminimum CET1 requirement, but excludes any additional CET1 needed to meet the 6% Tier 1 and \n8% Total Capital requirements, as well as any CET1 capital needed to meet D-SIBs’ Total Loss \nAbsorbing Capacity (TLAC) requirements where applicable. For example, an institution with 8% \nCET1 and no Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital would meet all minimum capital requirements, but \nwould have a 0% capital conservation buffer and therefore be subject to the 100% constraint on \ncapital distributions. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4] \n \nTable 5: Minimum capital conservation ratios for corresponding levels of CET1 \nCET1 Ratio Minimum Capital Conservation Ratios (expressed as percentage \nof earnings) \n4.5% - 5.125% 100% \n>5.125% - 5.75% 80% \n>5.75% - 6.375% 60% \n>6.375% - 7.0% 40% \n>7.0% 0% \n \n50. If an institution’s capital ratio falls below the levels set out in Table 4, capital \nconservation ratios will be imposed that automatically limit distributions. As outlined in Table 5, \nthese limits increase as an institution’s capital levels approach the minimum requirements. For \nexample, an institution with a CET1 capital ratio in the range of 5.125% to 5.75% would be \nrequired to maintain the equivalent of 80% of its earnings in the subsequent payment period (i.e. \npay out no more than 20% in capital distributions). For clarity, where an institution’s disclosed \nratio is within the ranges where restrictions apply, distributions for the following payment period \nwill be constrained based on the most recently reported ratio irrespective of the current capital \nposition of the institution. Restrictions will remain in place until the capital conservation buffer \nis restored. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4] \n \n \n14  Similar capital conservation ratios apply where an institution breaches its Tier 1 capital or Total capital \nrequirements. In the event that an institution simultaneously breaches more than one capital requirement (e.g. 7% \nCET1, 8.5% Tier 1, 10.5% Total capital) it must apply the most constraining capital conservation ratio.",

Earnings are calculated after the tax which \nwould have been reported had none of the distributable items been paid. As such, any tax \nimpacts of making such distributions are reversed out. Where an institution does not have \npositive earnings and has a shortfall in its CET1, Tier 1, or Total Capital ratio, it will be \nrestricted from making positive net distributions. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.5] \n \n1.7.2. Countercyclical Buffer \n \n53. The countercyclical buffer aims to ensure that banking sector capital requirements take \naccount of the macro-financial environment in which institutions operate. It will be deployed \nwhen excess aggregate credit growth is judged to be associated with a build-up of system-wide \nrisk to ensure the banking system has a buffer of capital to protect it against future potential \nlosses. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.7] \n \n54. The countercyclical buffer regime consists, in Canada, of the following elements: \n(a) OSFI, in consultation with its Senior Advisory Committee\n15 (SAC) partners, will monitor \ncredit growth and other indicators16 that may signal a build-up of system-wide risks17 and \nmake an assessment of whether credit growth is excessive and is leading to the build-up \nof system-wide risks. Based on this assessment, a countercyclical buffer requirement, \nranging from 0% to 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets,\n18 will be put in place when \n \n15  SAC is a non-statutory body chaired by the Deputy Minister of Finance. Its membership is the same as the \nFinancial Institutions Supervisory Committee (“FISC”), i.e. OSFI, the Department of Finance, the Bank of \nCanada, the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada. The SAC \noperates as a consultative body and provides a forum for policy discussion on issues pertaining to the financial \nsector.  \n16  The document entitled Guidance for national authorities operating the countercyclical capital buffer , sets out the \nprinciples that national authorities have agreed to follow in making buffer decisions. This document provides \ninformation that should help institutions to understand and anticipate the buffer decisions made by national \nauthorities in the jurisdictions to which they have credit exposures.

Domestic Stability Buffer \n \n67. In addition to the buffers described in sections 1.7.1, 1.7.2, and 1.8, D-SIBs are subject to \na Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB).\n32 The DSB is intended to cover a range of systemic \nvulnerabilities that, in OSFI’s supervisory judgement, are not adequately captured in the Pillar 1 \ncapital requirements described in this guideline. In addition to the DSB, D-SIBs may be required \nto hold further Pillar II capital, as warranted, to address idiosyncratic or systemic risks that are \nnot adequately captured by the Pillar I requirements and buffers. Decisions on the calibration of \nthe DSB are based on supervisory judgement, informed by analytical work on a range of \nvulnerabilities, and are made in consultation with the Financial Institutions Supervisory \nCommittee (FISC).\n33 \n \n68. The level of the DSB will range between 0 and 4.0% of a D-SIB’s total RWA calculated \nunder this guideline. The level of the DSB will be the same for all D-SIBs and must be met with \nCET1 capital.  \n \n69. Unlike the other buffers described in this guideline, the DSB is not a Pillar 1 buffer and \nbreaches will not result in D-SIBs being subject to the automatic constraints on capital \ndistributions described in section 1.7. If a D-SIB breaches the buffer (i.e. dips into the buffer \nwhen it has not been released), OSFI will require a remediation plan. Supervisory interventions \npursuant to OSFI’s Guide to Intervention\n34 would occur in cases where a remediation plan is not \nproduced or executed in a timely manner satisfactory to OSFI.  \n \n \n32   Details related to the OSFI’s DSB are included on OSFI’s website: Domestic Stability Buffer \n33   Established under section 18 of the OSFI Act, the Financial Institutions Supervisory Committee consists of the \nSuperintendent of Financial Institutions, the Commissioner of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, the \nGovernor of the Bank of Canada, the Chief Executive Officer of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, and \nthe Deputy Minister of Finance. \n34  Guide to Intervention for Federally Regulated Deposit-Taking Institutions",

D-SIBs should take into account the DSB in their internal capital planning process. \nAdditionally, D-SIBs should report the DSB in their quarterly public disclosures, and include a \nbrief narrative on any changes to the buffer level. Breaches of the buffer by an individual D-SIB \nwill require public disclosure pursuant to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). \n \n71. The specific vulnerabilities covered by the DSB are expected to evolve over time, as they \nare based on current market conditions in combination with forward-looking expectations around \nthe materialization of risks to key vulnerabilities, and will be communicated as part of the semi-\nannual DSB level-setting announcements. The decision to include a vulnerability will be based \non whether it is measurable, material, cyclical and has a system-wide impact that could \nmaterialize in the foreseeable future.  \n \n72. OSFI will undertake a review of the buffer on a semi-annual basis, and any changes to \nthe buffer will be made public, in June and December, along with supporting rationale. In \nexceptional circumstances, OSFI may make and announce adjustments to the buffer in-between \nscheduled review dates. Transparency in setting the DSB will support institutions’ ability to use \nthis capital in times of stress by improving the understanding of the purpose of the buffer and \nhow it should be used.  \n \n73. Decreases of the buffer may occur in a situation when OSFI identifies that D-SIBs’ \nexposures to the vulnerabilities have diminished or that risks have materialized. In the latter case, \na decrease would be intended to allow D-SIBs to continue to provide loans and services to credit \nworthy households and businesses and/or to incur losses without breaching their capital targets. \nIncreases to the buffer may occur when OSFI is of the view that it would be prudent for D-SIBs \nto hold additional capital to protect against the identified vulnerabilities. Increases will be subject \nto a phase-in period; decreases will be effective immediately. \n \n1. 10. Capital Targets \n \n74. In addition to the minimum capital requirements described in section 1.6, OSFI expects \nall institutions to maintain target capital ratios equal to or greater than the minimum capital ratios \nplus the conservation buffer.\n35 For SMSBs, this means target ratios of at least 7% for CET1, \n8.5% for Tier 1 and 10.5% for Total capital. D-SIBs are expected to maintain target capital ratios \nequal to or greater than the minimum capital ratios plus the sum of the conservation buffer, the \nD-SIB surcharge and the DSB. For D-SIBs, this equates to target ratios of least 8% for CET1, \n9.5% for Tier 1, and 11.5% for Total capital plus the DSB.36 The target capital ratios for SMSBs \nand D-SIBs are summarized below in Table 8 below and illustrated in Annex 2.  \n \n \n \n \n \n35   The conservation buffer is the sum of the 2.5% capital conservation buffer plus any countercyclical buffer add-\nons, where applicable. \n36   As an example, where the DSB is set to 2% of RWA, D-SIBs’ target capital ratios would be at least 10% for \nCET1, 11.5% for Tier 1 and 13.5% for Total capital. This reflects a conservation buffer of 2.5% and a D -SIB \nsurcharge of 1.0%.",

The framework39 for dealing with D-SIBs set out by the BCBS indicates that domestic \nsystemic importance should be assessed with reference to the impact that an institution’s failure \ncould have on the domestic economy. Further, it notes that this assessment should consider \ninstitution-specific characteristics of systemic importance, such as size, inter-connectedness and \nsubstitutability, which are correlated with the systemic impact of failure. Accordingly, OSFI’s \nassessment of domestic systemic importance for Canadian institutions considers a range of \nindicators such as asset size, intra-financial claims and liabilities, and an institution’s roles in \ndomestic financial markets and in financial infrastructures. This section describes OSFI’s \ninferences from various measures of systemic importance.  \n \nSize  \n \n2. In general, an institution’s distress or failure is more likely to damage the Canadian \nfinancial system or economy if its activities comprise a large share of domestic banking activity. \nWhen Canadian institutions are compared according to their size as measured by total \nconsolidated assets, and by place of booking of assets, that is, according to whether the assets are \nbooked in Canada or abroad, the data show that: \n• the largest six banks account for more than 90% total banking assets; \n• the differences among the largest banks are smaller if only domestic assets are \nconsidered; and \n• relative systemic importance declines rapidly after the top five banks and after the \nsixth bank.  \n \nInter-connections \n \n3. The more inter-connected an institution is to other financial institutions, the greater is the \npotential for the failure of that institution to transmit problems throughout the financial system \nand to the broader economy. As a result, measurements of inter-connectedness also inform \ninstitutions’ systemic importance. Comparing Canadian institutions according to measures of \nintra-financial assets (i.e. claims on other financial institutions) and intra-financial liabilities (i.e. \nobligations to other financial institutions) again points to the dominance of the largest Canadian \nbanks. The rank-ordering among these banks, however, depends on the specific inter-\nconnectedness measure under consideration.   \n \nSubstitutability \n \n4. The systemic impact of an institution’s distress or failure is greater the less easily it can \nbe replaced as both a market participant and a financial service provider. As a result, OSFI’s \nidentification of D-SIBs also takes into account the types of roles that institutions play in \ndomestic financial markets and in domestic financial infrastructures, which inform views \nregarding substitutability. For example, this includes underwriter rankings in Canadian financial \n \n39  A framework for dealing with domestic systemically important banks (BCBS: October 2012)",

The largest \nbanks are also the dominant participants in CDSX, the clearing and settlement system for \nsecurities transactions in Canada. Some large Canadian banks also play key roles as members of \nthe CLS Bank, the global institution that settles foreign exchange transactions between banks in \nCanadian dollars and other major currencies.41 For example, the Royal Bank of Canada and the \nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce are the key Canadian-dollar liquidity providers for \nsettling Canadian dollar foreign exchange transactions through the CLS network. \n \n5. A variety of additional information has been assessed and recurring themes across the \nrange of evidence are the following:  \n• The five largest banks are by far the dominant banks in Canada, and consistently play \ncentral roles in a range of activities in the Canadian financial system; and   \n• The rank-order importance of the largest banks, as well as the relative differences \nbetween them, varies somewhat according to the measure considered.   \n \n6. This suggests that there are strong grounds for treating these banks in the same way, \nrather than relying on arbitrary weights to develop a single index of systemic importance. \nFurther, distinguishing reliably between the adverse effects on the Canadian economy from \nindividual D-SIB failures is largely moot, given the difficulty of credibly differentiating between \nthe large adverse impacts on the Canadian economy from the failure of any one of the largest \nbanks. This also argues against making distinctions between identified Canadian D-SIBs to \nassign degrees of systemic importance.\n  \n \n7. Given these various considerations, the Canadian D-SIBs are judged to be Bank of \nMontreal, The Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank of \nCanada, and The Toronto-Dominion Bank, without further distinction between them. National \nBank of Canada has also been designated as a D-SIB given its importance relative to other less \nprominent banks and in the interest of prudence given the inherent challenges in identifying \nahead of time which banks are likely to be systemic in times of stress. The designation of D-SIB \nstatus will be periodically reviewed and updated as needed.  \n \nHigher Loss Absorbency Targets \n \n8. The goal of a higher loss absorbency target is to reduce further the probability of failure \nof a D-SIB relative to non-systemic institutions, reflecting the greater impact that a D-SIB failure \nmay have on the domestic financial system and the economy. This surcharge takes into account \nthe structure of the Canadian financial system, the importance of large banks to the financial \narchitecture, and the expanded regulatory toolkit required to resolve a troubled financial \n \n40   ACSS handles all Canadian dollar payments not processed by the LVTS. \n41  CLS Bank provides a real-time global network that links a number of national payments systems to settle the \nforeign exchange transactions of its member banks",

The BCBS D-SIB framework provides for national discretion to accommodate \ncharacteristics of the domestic financial system and other local features, including the domestic \npolicy framework. The additional capital surcharge for banks designated as systemically \nimportant provides credible additional loss absorbency given: \n• extreme loss events as a percentage of RWA among this peer group over the past 25 \nyears would be less than the combination of the CET1 (2.5%) capital conservation \nbuffer and an additional 1%; and \n• current business models of the six largest banks are generally less exposed to the fat \ntailed risks associated with investment banking than some international peers, and the \nsix largest banks have a greater reliance on retail funding models compared to \nwholesale funding than some international peers – features that proved beneficial in \nlight of the experience of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. \nFrom a forward-looking perspective: \n• Canadian D-SIBs that hold capital at current targets plus a 1% surcharge (i.e. 8%) \nshould be able to weather a wide range of severe but plausible shocks without \nbecoming non-viable; and  \n• the higher loss absorbency in a crisis scenario achieved by the conversion to common \nequity) of the 2% to 3% in Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 NVCC capital instruments \npromoted by Basel III also adds to the resiliency of banks.  \n \nRelationship with Basel Committee G-SIB Framework \n \n9. OSFI has adopted the Basel Committee’s framework on the assessment methodology for \nG-SIBs. The assessment methodology for G-SIBs follows an indicator-based approach agreed by \nthe BCBS that will determine which institutions are to be designated as G-SIBs and subject to \nadditional loss absorbency requirements that range from 1% to 3.5% RWA, depending on an \ninstitution's global systemic importance.\n42 For Canadian D-SIBs that are also designated as G-\nSIBs, the higher of the D-SIB and G-SIB surcharges will apply.43  \n \nSupervisory Implications \n \n10. Canadian D-SIBs are expected to have advanced practices in terms of the design and \noperation of oversight functions and internal controls. OSFI expects these practices to continue \nto improve as supervision becomes more intensive and international best practices evolve. The \ninstitutions designated as D-SIBs have historically had, and will continue to be subject to, more \nintensive supervision because of their larger size, broader and more complex business models \nand consequently more significant risk profiles. The principles of risk based supervisory \nintensity are reflected in OSFI’s Supervisory Framework.\n44 The Framework is applied on a \nconsolidated basis to all Canadian institutions and requires OSFI supervisors to determine the \n \n42   BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.1 to 40.6 and SCO 40.1 to 50.20  \n43   Details related to G-SIB’s annual public disclosure requirements are included in OSFI’s Global Systemically \nImportant Banks – Public Disclosure Requirements Advisory    \n44  OSFI’s Supervisory Framework (OSFI: February 2011)",
